Al Franken,"I'm Al Franken: Minnesotan, Senator, and world-renowned expert on right-wing megalomaniacs: Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and now Donald Trump.A little about my qualifications. I got my doctorate in megalomania studies from Trump University. Sure, I had to empty out my 401(k) and take out a reverse mortgage on my house to pay the tuition. But Mr. Trump or, rather, some people who said they'd once met him, convinced me it was worth it.And frankly, as a proud alum of Trump U, I think we may be underestimating Donald Trump. Sure, he's scammed a lot of people. But did you know that Trump University's School of Ripping People Off is ranked second in the nation? Right behind Bernie Madoff University? That's no mean feat.And Trump University is about more than just bilking people. Although, trust me, you will get bilked. It 's also about learning directly from success experts like Scott Baio, Mike Tyson, and, of course, a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump himself.Now, of course, Trump University wouldn't be Trump University without its business school. Their bankruptcy program in particular is known throughout the real estate/investment community for its creativity. The most popular course, Bankruptcy 101, or, ''How to Leave Your Partners Holding the Bag,'' is taught by the cardboard cutout itselfThe pride of Trump University, of course, is its library, located on a shelf in a closet on the third floor of Trump Tower. All of Mr. Trump's bestsellers are available for sale at a special student rate, which is 10 percent higher than the retail price.Clearly, Donald Trump's enormous, dare I say ''huge,'' success as a businessman qualifies him to be President. And  if you believe that, I've got some delicious Trump Steaks I'd like to sell you.In all seriousness, I think rather than voting for someone who's never done anything for anyone other than himself, maybe we should go with the candidate who's spent her entire life working to get important things done for the American people.I've known Hillary for a quarter-century . I've never met anyone smarter, tougher , or more ready to lead us forward. I am proud to call Hillary Clinton my friend. And I can't wait to call her Madam President.Now, we're going to have a lot of fun this week. But when we wake up Friday morning, there will be just 102 days left until the election. And what you- yes, you - do in those 102 days could determine who wins. I mean that literally. I won my first race for the Senate by 312 votesWhere's my Minnesota delegation? There are people there who talked to 312 voters by themselves. Each one of them, individually, is the reason I'm giving this speech here and not into my bathroom mirror.My friend Paul Wellstone used to say, ''The future belongs to those who are passionate and work hard.'' This week is about passion. But starting Friday morning, it's all about hard work.Many of you have jobs. Many of you have families. Ignore them. Let me tell you something: kids love it when their parents aren't home. And let me tell you something else. An 8-year-old knows how to use a microwave. And let me tell you something else. An 8-year-old can teach a 4-year-old how to use a microwave. That's just scientific fact. They'll be fine.You have work to do. Get on those phones. Knock on those doors. And tell 'em Al Franken sent you.",1,,,
Anastasia Somoza,"I first met Hillary as First Lady on a visit to the White House. I was nine years old and I listened to her and my mom discuss health care and early intervention for children with disabilities. She has continued to serve; over the past 23 years, she has continued to serve as a friend and mentor, championing my inclusion and access to classrooms, higher education and the workforce. She has never lost touch with people like me. She has invested in me. She believes in me.And in a country where 56 million Americans with disabilities so often feel invisible, Hillary Clinton sees me. She sees me as a strong woman, a young professional, a hard worker and the proud daughter of immigrants -- my father from Nicaragua and my mother from Ireland. She has shown me that all these aspects of my identity are strengths which will help me affect change. I fear the day we elect a president who defines being American in the narrowest possible terms, who shouts, bullies and profits off of the vulnerable Americans. Donald Trump has shown us who he really is, and I honestly feel bad for anyone with that much hate in their heart. I know we must show each other and the world who we really are in November when we choose genuine strength and thoughtful leadership over fear and division. Donald Trump doesn't see me. He doesn't hear me. And he definitely doesn't speak for me. I am confident that as our president Hillary will do everything in her power to promote the rights, empowerment, and humanity of all Americans. She knows that when we support access to education and employment opportunities for absolutely everyone, more of us will be able to live happy, independent lives, and to promote, build, and contribute to this great country. As president, Hillary Clinton will continue fighting and inspiring us all with her brave vision and tireless efforts on our behalf. On the eve of the 26th anniversary of the American with Disabilities Act, I'm proud to be with you, Hillary. Thank you for showing me how to live boldly with a courageous heart.",1,,,
Astrid Silva,"When I was four years old, my mother and I climbed into a raft and we crossed the river to join my father in America in search of a better life. All I had was a little doll. I grew up like an ordinary girl. My dad worked as a landscaper and my mom stayed at home with my brother and I. But while my friends did ordinary things, I couldn't because my parents were afraid that someone might discover I was undocumented. My family believed so deeply in the promise of this country that we risked everything for the American dream. As an undocumented student, I felt like college was out of reach. But after a journey[inaudible]I finally graduated from Nevada State College. My family and I are here because of people like Senator Harry Reid -- [Spanish audio] -- who put themselves in our shoes and helped us. And while President Obama's immigration action protected me, we live in constant fear that my parents could be taken away from their grandson, Noah. So when Donald Trump talks about deporting 11 million people, he's talking about ripping families apart, separating families like mine and like Karla's. Hillary Clinton understands that this is not who we are as a country. I have seen her comfort children like Karla [Ortiz] who are scared that they might lose their parents to deportation. I know she will fight to keep our families together. [Spanish audio] I know she will.",1,,,
Bernie Sanders,"Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! Thank you!It is an honor to be here tonight and to be following in the footsteps of my good friend Elizabeth Warren.And to be here tonight to thank Michelle Obama for her incredible service to our country.She has made all of us proud.Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign and volunteered. Thank you.Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributions.Anyone know what that average contribution was? That's right, $27.And let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolutiongiving us the 1,856th pledged delegates here tonight!And delegates, thank you for being here and thank you for all the work you have done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call tomorrow night!And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor, congressman, senator and presidential candidate.And to my family, my wife, Jane, our four kids and seven grandchildren, thank you very much!I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it's fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am.But to all of our supporters here and around the country, I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishment we have achieved.Together, together, my friends, we have begun a political revolution to transform America, and that revolution, our revolution, continues![The neat political trick that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders played on Monday night]Election days come and go, but the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice, that struggle continues!And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you.Let me be as clear as I can be. This election is not about and has never been about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency. This election is not about political gossip, it's not about polls, it's not about campaign strategy, it is not about all the things that the media spends so much time discussing.This election is about and must be about the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and our grandchildren.This election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class.The reality that 47 million men, women and children today live in poverty. It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy, our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living than their parents.This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in America today!It is not moral, it is not acceptable, and it is not sustainable that the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.Or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change.This election is about remembering where we were seven-and-a-half years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle-down economics.The Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. That's where we were. That is where we were. Some 800,000 people a month were losing their jobs, 800,000 people. We were running up a record- breaking deficit of $1.4 trillion. And by the way, the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse. That's where we were when President Obama came into office.Well, we have come a long way in the last seven-and-a- half years and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden!I thank them for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession.Yes, we have made progress, but I think we can all agree that much, much more needs to be done.This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions.Not just bombast, not just fear-mongering, not just name-calling and divisiveness. We need leadership in this country, which will improve the lives of working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger.Not leadership which insults Latinos and Mexicans, insults Muslims and women, African Americans and veterans and seeks to divide us up.By these measures, any objective observer will conclude that based on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States.[Bernie Sanders's big convention speech was the same speech he gave when he first endorsed Hillary Clinton]This election is about a single mother, a single mom I saw in Nevada who, with tears in her eyes, told me she was scared to death about the future because she and her daughter were not making it on the $10.45 an hour she was earning. This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages.Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in this country works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage!And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater plants.But her opponent, Donald Trump, well, he has a very different point of view. He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, a starvation wage.While Trump believes in huge tax breaks, huge tax breaks for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.Brothers and sisters, this election is about overturning Citizens United!Citizens United is one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country.That decision allows the wealthiest people in America, like the billionaire Koch brothersto spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and in the process undermine American democracy.Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United!And end the movement toward oligarchy that we are seeing in this country.Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman's right to choose.workers' rights, the rights of the LGBT communitythe needs of minorities and immigrants and the government's ability to protect our environment.If you don't believe that this election is important, if you think you can sit it out, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country.This election is about the thousands of young people I have met all over this country.The thousands that I have met who left college deeply in debt and, tragically, the many others who cannot afford to go to college.During the primary campaign, Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue, but with somewhat different approaches. Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America.It will guarantee -- guarantee -- that the children of any family in this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less, 83 percent of our population, will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free.That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.This election is about climate change, the great environmental crisis facing our planet.And the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our children and future generations.Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that unless we act boldly to transform our energy system in the very near future, there will be more drought, more floods, more acidification of the oceans, more rising sea levels. She understands that we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs transforming our energy system.Donald Trump? Well, like most Republicans he chooses to reject science.He believes that climate change is a hoax, no need to address it. Hillary Clinton understands that a president's job is to worry about future generations, not the profits of the fossil fuel industry.This campaign is about moving the United States toward universal health care and reducing the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured.Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange.She believes that anyone 55 or older should be able to opt-in to Medicare.And she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers.And what is Donald Trump's position on health care? Well, no surprise there, same old, same old Republican contempt for working families. He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off of health insuranceand cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans.Hillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors, disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine we use. She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry.And that drug companies should not be making billions in profit when one out of five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need. The greed of the drug companies must end!This election is about the leadership we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and repair a broken criminal justice system.It's about making sure that young people in this country are in good schools and in good jobs, not rotting in jail cells.Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails or incarceration.In these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up.While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths.Yes, we become stronger when black and whites, Latino, Asian American, Native American, when all of us stand together.Yes, we become stronger when men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant fight together to create the kind of country we all know we can become.It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That is what this campaign has been about. That is what democracy is about.So I'm happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced by far the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.Among many, many other strong provisions, the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Streetand the passage of a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act.It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing trade agreements like the TPP.We have got to make sure that TPP does not get to the floor of the Congress in the lame-duck session!Our job now is to see that strong Democratic platform implemented by a Democratic-controlled Senateby a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency!And I am going to do all that I can to make that happen.I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I remember her, as you do, as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care.I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children, for women and for the disabled.Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight!Thank you all very much!",1,,,
Bob Brady,"Welcome to Philadelphia, the city that's made America free, today makes history again. This is the birthplace of our great democracy -- the home of Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. But independence and liberty have never been given. We have had to fight for and defend these principles each generation. That has always been the work of the brave men and women of the armed services. To all those who have served or have loved ones serving, thank you!To all that have defended our freedom and never came home, prisoners of war and those missing in action, we remember you! You are not forgotten!As Americans living in freedom, each of us has a responsibility to always remember the sacrifices of those that did not come home. And those whose safe return we are still waiting for, we hold them in our hearts every single day. Across this great land and throughout the greater Philadelphia in venues from City Hall through sports arenas, an empty chair honors our missing heroes. I was proud to pass a law to place one such chair in the United States Capitol forever. And at this Democratic convention, we also saved them a seat -- an empty chair that will serve as a reminder of those members and POWs and what they did for our country. A reminder that we all have a responsibility to remember. Please turn to the Pennsylvania delegation where we keep this meaningful memorial. The POW MIA National Chair of Honor. Right here at the Pennsylvania delegation. Now I ask all of you to stand and observe a moment of silence for our POW MIA Americans. Please stand. Thank you. And thank you for honoring the courage and commitment to our great community. Let's give them one more rousing round of applause. Thank you to our veterans. Let's go New York, I can't hear you. Virginia? How about Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania, let's give it up for our veterans!",1,,,
Bob Casey,"Philadelphia, the place where American independence began and where our Constitution was born. Since the time of William Penn, Pennsylvania has been a commonwealth of creators, of makers, of builders who every day invent the future. My father, Governor Casey, believed that we must never forget the ''the sweat and blood of working men and women who built Pennsylvania, forged the industrial revolution in our country and out-produced the world.''With family roots in Scranton and her many visits to the state over the years, Hillary Clinton understands this. She'll work every day to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. But what about Donald Trump? Donald Trump says he stands for workers and that he'll put America first. But that's not how he's conducted himself in business. Where are his, quote, ''tremendous'' Trump products made? Doctorss shirts: Bangladesh. Furniture: Turkey. Picture frames: India. Wine glasses: Slovenia. Neckties: China. China. Why would Donald Trump make products in every corner of the world but not in Altoona, Erie or here in Philadelphia? Well, this is what he said -- quote -- ''Outsourcing is not always a terrible thing.'' Wages in America -- quote -- ''are too high.'' And then he complained about companies moving jobs overseas because -- quote -- ''We don't make things anymore.'' Really?! Well, tell that to the union workers at All-Clad in Canonsburg who make the pots and pans found in many of our kitchens. Tell that to the employees of K'NEX in Hatfield who create toys that teach our children about engineering and architecture. Tell that to the robotics students at Carnegie Mellon who are building 21st-century robots and cars that drive themselves. Donald Trump hasn't made anything in his life except a buck on the backs of working people. If he is a champion of working people, I'm the starting center for the 76ers. The man who wants to make America great doesn't make anything in America. And it's insulting that he has no plan -- no plan -- to support the men and women who are manufacturing products here at home. All he has are empty promises like so many he's made and failed to follow through on before. If you believe that outsourcing has been good for working people and has raised incomes for the middle class, then you should vote for Donald Trump. I'm voting for Hillary Clinton. She believes Hillary believes we need an economy that works for everyone, not just Donald Trump and those at the top. We need to commit ourselves to making good paying jobs here at home so that everyone who works hard can get ahead and stay there. That's why her first hundred days in office, President Hillary Clinton will put forward the largest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. As president, she rewards businesses that share profits with their employees. She'll slap a new exit tax on companies that move overseas while rewarding companies that invest here at home. And she'll strengthen our economy by investing $10 billion in new, advanced manufacturing jobs that can't be sent overseas. This November, we have a choice. You can choose a candidate who's only out for himself, who wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage, and who would cut taxes for the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class. Or you can choose Hillary Clinton, a leader with a proven track record of fighting for an economy that works for all of us. If you're with her like I am, sign up and volunteer at HillaryClinton.com. Thank you!",1,,,
Brendan Boyle,"Welcome to the nation's birthplace, my hometown, Philadelphia. Right here, in the sweltering summer of 1776, a nation was conceived not for a single race or religion but out of a shared commitment to powerful ideals that would inspire the world over. My father came to America when he was 19. He came here to enjoy the same rights and pursue the same opportunities that our founders dream of two centuries ago. He knew that in this country his children will be considered just as American as the descendants of the Mayflower. My father was a janitor, cleaning the same train stations many of us rode past to get here tonight. My mother was a school crossing guard. My brother and I grew up in a small Philadelphia row home where we were raised to believe that in this country if you work hard, where you come from doesn't determine where you're going. Thanks to many sacrifices, a lot of student loans, and a little luck, I became the first in my family to go to college. As Democrats, our mission is to make more stories like mine more common, not less so. But all Donald Trump wants to do is tell you who's to blame, to fan the flames of anxiety and to exploit them in the most negative, divisive, dangerous ways. This is why Hillary Clinton's vision is so important. It's the opportunity for wages that help Americans join the middle class and stay there, a plan to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work, a pathway to college and a ladder into the working world. Now Donald Trump says the American dream is dead. Why does he want to lead America when he doesn't even believe in America? Donald Trump is wrong. This is a remarkable country, by geography and by destiny, we are a land set apart. We Democrats come to Philadelphia this week to reaffirm our commitment to our founding ideals. We come here to renew our fight to make the American dream a reality for all. We come here to elect Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States!",1,,,
Cheryl Lankford,"When you lose a spouse, you know that your life will change forever. You know that it won't be easy. But I didn't expect that on top of grieving the loss of my husband and trying to take care of my baby, I would also be the victim of a scam. You just saw what happened to me, how Trump University cheated me out of the money I received after my husband's death, how they broke their promises, how they stopped taking my calls, how they whole thing was a lie. By conning me out of the money the military gave me after my husband died, I felt like Trump University was disrespecting Jonathan's [sp] memory. I was furious, frightened, and the truth is I was embarrassed. The worst part was that I wasn't the only victim of Donald Trump's greed. Far from it.He preyed on vulnerable people, like military widows and the elderly. He made millions of dollars off of people like me -- millions. He cheated more than 5,000 students, hardworking middle class folks -- teachers, police officers, even veterans. These are folks just like me who didn't have a lot but who were told that if they paid for Donald Trump's program they might be able to make a better living. Here's a guy who was born rich and who has all the money in the world and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I signed for Trump University because I thought I could learn something from him. But when he decided to make himself even richer by cheating working people who had nothing to spare. What kind of a man does that? It's not easy for me to get up here and tell my story. For a long time, I didn't tell anybody, not even my family or my friends. But I'm here because America deserves to know the truth. This election isn't about Democrat versus Republican; it's about right versus wrong. It's about someone who helps ordinary people no matter what it takes versus someone who helps himself no matter who it hurts. Donald Trump made big promises about Trump University, and I was fooled into believing him. Now, he's making big promises about America. Please don't make that same mistake.",1,,,
Cory Booker,"Hello, Philadelphia. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.Two hundred and forty years ago, our forefathers gathered in this very city and they declared before the world that we would be a free and independent nation. Today, we gather here again in this city, in this city of brotherly love, to reaffirm our values before our nation and the whole world.Our purpose is not like theirs, to start a great nation, but to ensure that we continue in the best of our traditions, and with humble homage to generations of patriots before, we put forth two great Americans, our nominees for president and vice president, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.Now, looking back to our history, looking back to our history, our founding fathers put forth founding documents that were indeed genius. But our founding documents weren't genius because they were perfect. They were saddled with the imperfections and even the bigotry of the past. Native Americans were referred to as savages. Black Americans were fractions of human beings. And women were not mentioned at all.But those facts and ugly parts of our history don't distract from our nation's greatness. In fact, I believe we are an even greater nation, not because we started perfect, but because every generation has successfully labored to make us a more perfect union.Generations of heroic Americans have made our nation more inclusive, more expansive, and more just.Our nation wasn't founded because we all look alike or prayed alike or descended from the same family tree. But our founders, in their genius, in this, the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet Earth, they put forth the idea that all are created equal, that we have inalienable rights.And I'm so proud that upon this faithful foundation that we built a great nation. And today, no matter who you are Ñ rich or poor, Asian or white, man or woman, gay or straight, any religion or none at all Ñ you are entitled to the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship.In this city, our founders put forth a Declaration of Independence, but let me tell you, they also made a historic declaration of interdependence. They knew that if this country was to survive and thrive, we had to make an unusual and extraordinary commitment to each other.Look, I respect and value the ideals of individualism and self- reliance. But rugged individualism didn't defeat the British. It didn't get us to the moon. It didn't build our nation's highways. Rugged individualism didn't map the human genome. We did that together.And so this is the high call of patriotism. Patriotism is love of country. But you can't love your country without loving your countrymen and your countrywomen. Now, we don't always have to agree, but we must be there for each other, we must empower each other, we must find the common ground, and we must build bridges across our differences to pursue the common good.Let me tell you, we cannot devolve into our Ñ to a nation where our highest aspirations are that we just tolerate each other. We are not called to be a nation of tolerance. We are called to be a nation of love.That's why that last line in the Declaration of Independence says it so clearly. It says that we must Ñ to make this nation work, we must mutually pledge to each other our lives and our fortunes and our sacred honor. Tolerance is the wrong way. Tolerance says I'm just going to stomach your right to be different, that if you disappear from the face of the Earth, I'm no better or worse off.But love Ñ love knows that every American has worth and value, that no matter what their background, no matter what their race or religion or sexual orientation, love, love recognizes that we need each other, that we as a nation are better together, that when we are divided we are weak, we decline, yet when we are united, we are strong, when we are indivisible, we are invincible.This is the understanding of love that's embodied in one of my favorite savings. It's an African saying, and it says, ''If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.''This is the reason why I am so motivated in this election, because I believe this election is a referendum on who best embodies the leadership we need to go far together.Donald Trump is not that leader. We've watched him try to get laughs at other people's expense, try to incite fear at a time we need to inspire courage, try to rise in the polls by dragging our national conversation into the gutter. We've watched him mock, cruelly mock a journalist's disability. We've watched him demean the service of my Senate colleague, saying, ''He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured.'' Trump said, ''I don't like people who get captured.'' Would he say that to POWs from World War II? Would he say that to POWs from Vietnam? Would he say that to the brave men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan right now, risking capture or worse? That's not the commander-in-chief.We've watched Donald Trump paint with a broad, divisive brush, saying that Mexican immigrants who came to build a better life in America are, in his words, ''bringing crime, they're bringing drugs.'' He called many of them rapists. He said that an Indiana-born federal judge can't be trusted to do his job because of his Mexican ancestry, a statement that his fellow Republicans have described as racist.(AUDIENCE BOOS)We've watched Donald Trump, our children, our daughters, our nieces and grandkids have watched Donald Trump and heard him calling women degrading and demeaning names, ''Dog.'' ''Fat pig.'' ''Disgusting.'' ''Animal.'' It's a twisted hypocrisy when he treats other women in a manner he would never, ever accept from another man speaking about his daughters or his wife.In this great nation, where our founders put a fundamental principle forward of religious freedom, he says ban all Muslims, don't let certain people into our America because of how they pray.Now, I take particular interest in the fact that Trump says he would run our country like he's run his businesses. Well, I'm from Jersey.And I'm from the great Garden State. And we've seen how he leads in Atlantic City. He got rich while his companies declared multiple bankruptcies. Yet, without remorse, even as people got hurt and lost jobs by his failures, he bragged, and I quote, ''The money I took out of there was incredible.''Yes, he took out a lot of cash, but he stiffed contractors, many of them small businesses, refusing to pay them for the work that they'd done. You know, we in America have seen enough of a handful of people growing rich at the cost of a nation descending into crisis.America, at our best, we stand up to bullies, and we fight those who seek to demean and degrade other Americans. In times of crisis, we don't abandon our values; we double down on them.Even amidst the crisis of the Civil War, Lincoln stood up and called out to all of our country, saying, ''With malice towards none and charity towards all.'' This is our history. This is the history that I was taught.My parents never wanted my brother and I to get too heady. Gratitude was our gravity. So they never stopped reminding me my brother and I that our blessings sprang from countless ordinary Americans who showed extraordinary acts of kindness, decency and love, people who struggled and sweat and bled for our rights, people who paid the ultimate price for the freedoms we all enjoy. I was told that we can't pay those Americans back for their colossal acts of service, but we have an obligation to pay it forward to others through our service and our sacrifice.I support Hillary Clinton because these are her values, and she has been paying it forward her entire life.Long before Ñ long before she got in politics, she was in Massachusetts going door-to-door collecting the stories of children with disabilities. In South Carolina, she fought to reform the juvenile justice system so that children wouldn't be thrown in adult prisons. In Alabama, she helped expose the remnants of segregation in schools. In Arkansas, she started a legal aid clinic to make sure poor folks could get their day in court.She has fought for the people, and she's delivered. That's why we trust her to fight and deliver for us as president.But let me tell you, we have a presidential nominee in Clinton who knows that, in a time of stunningly wide disparities of wealth in our nation, that America's greatness must not be measured by how many millionaires and billionaires we have, but by how few people we have living in poverty.Hillary knows that when workers make a fair wage, it doesn't just help their families, it builds a stronger and more durable economy that expands opportunity and makes all of us Americans wealthier.She knows that in a global knowledge-based economy, the country that out-educates the world will out-earn the world, out-innovate the world, and will lead the world.She knows that debt-free college is not a gift, it's not charity, it is an investment. It represents the best of our values, the best of our history, and the best of our party, all of our shared ideas and values together.Hillary Clinton knows that when we have paid family leave that this something that must happen, because when a parent doesn't have to choose between being there for a sick child and paying rent, or when a single mom earns an equal wage for equal work, it empowers the most important building block in all of our nation, and that is the family.Hillary Clinton knows that security doesn't come from scapegoating other people because of their religion, alienating our allies, stoking fear and pointing fingers. It comes when we band together to face down and defeat our common enemy.And she knows something that I fight for every day, that our criminal justice system desperately needs reform, that we need to bring back fairness to a system that still, as Professor Bryan Stevenson says, treats you better if you are rich and guilty than poor and innocent.And she knows that we can be a nation that both believes police officers deserve more respect, they deserve more support, more cooperation and love, and believes that a black 20-something-year-old protestor deserves to be valued, deserves to be held, that they should be listened to with more courageous empathy, and that change is needed in the system.And Hillary Clinton knows what Donald Trump betrays time and time again in this campaign, that we are not a zero-sum nation. It is not you or me. It is not one American against another American. It is you and I, together, interdependent, interconnected, with one single interwoven destiny.When we respect each other, when we stand up for each other, when we work together against our challenges, against our neighbors' challenges, be it a neighbor with a beautiful special needs child or one struggling with the ugly disease of addiction, when we as Americans help them, when we show compassion and grace, when we evidence our truth, that we are the United States of America, one nation, under God, indivisible, that is when we are stronger. That is when we go from an already great America to an even greater America.Now, let me tell you, let me tell you right now, when Trump spews insulting and demeaning words about our fellow Americans, I think of that poem by Maya Angelou. You all know it. You know how it begins. ''You may write me down in history, with your bitter, twisted lies, you may trod me in the very dirt, but still, like dust, I rise.''Well, y'all know it. Y'all know it. This Ñ this Ñ this captures our American history. Two hundred forty years ago, an English king said he would crush our rebellion, but Americans from around our nation joined the fight. From Bunker Hill to the Battle of Trenton, they stood, and so many fell, giving their lives in support of our daring declaration that America, we will rise.This is our history.This is our history. Escaped slaves, knowing that liberty is not secure for some until it's secure for all, sometimes hungry, often hunted, in dark woods and deep swamps, they looked up to the North Star and said, with a determined whisper, America, we will rise.Immigrants, immigrants risking their lives in times of sweatshops and child labor, they organized labor unions and devoted themselves to lifting the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses, with fiercest of grit, they shouted so all could hear, America, we will rise.King pointed to the mountaintop, Kennedy pointed to the moon, from Seneca Falls to those who stood at Stonewall Inn, giants before us said in a chorus of conviction, America, we will rise.My fellow Americans Ñ my fellow Americans, we cannot fall into the complacency or indifference about this election, because still the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing. You know the saying.My fellow Americans, we cannot be seduced by cynicism about our politics, because cynicism is a refuge for cowards, and this nation is and must always be the home of the brave.We are the United States of America. We will not falter or fail. We will not retreat or surrender our values. We will not surrender our ideas. We will not surrender the moral high ground.Here in Philadelphia, let us declare again that we will be a free people. Free from fear and intimidation. Let us declare, again, that we are a nation of interdependence, and that in America, love always trumps hate.Let us declare Ñ let us declare so that generations yet unborn can hear us. We are the United States of America. Our best days are ahead of us. And together, with Hillary Clinton as our president, America, we will rise.God bless America. Let us rise together. God bless America.",1,,,
Dannel Malloy,"I am here today to tell you a story of hope -- a story of why we are stronger together. It's a story of a young boy with physical and severe learning disabilities. A child for whom reading and writing were almost impossible. A child thought to be, as the term used in the early 1960's, mentally retarded as late as the fourth grade. A boy who could not tie his shoe or button his shirt until the fifth grade. Someone who knew the harsh words of bullies in the playground and discrimination in the classroom. But that boy had great teachers, and he had a mother who believed deeply in giving him the opportunities for success. He had a support system that believed that we are stronger together when we lift up those who fall behind. And that boy was lifted up, he learned his strengths. He overcame his difficulties. He went on to be successful in college and law school, then earning the right to be the first learning impaired person to take the essay portion of the bar exam orally in three different states. And today that boy is now grown up and is standing before you as the governor of the state of Connecticut and proud to be addressing the Democratic National Convention. See, this is my story -- a story of why we are stronger together. It's an American story. After all, our communities are bound by the shared understanding that we are stronger together, that we need to lift up our brothers and sisters, and ignore the shouts and taunts of bullies amongst us. That is one reason why I am a Democrat, and that is why I am proud to support Hillary Clinton for president of the United States. Why Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine?I believe that we must instill hope in every American. It doesn't matter their race, their gender, who they love, or where their parents were born, or their religion, or what their learning abilities are. Every child, every American deserves to have an opportunity to be successful in this life. That's what we stand for as Democratic governors. We stand for solving problems and bringing hope to more Americans -- hope for fairer wages, hope for better schools, and hope for more time to spend with the families they love. We're proud to count amongst our alumni former Gov. Bill Clinton and we're proud to count amongst our alumni former Gov. Tim Kaine. Tim Kaine, who as governor of Virginia, led his state through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression while creating jobs in the process. And today I am here to tell you that the middle class in America is getting stronger thanks to the work of Democratic governors. In Washington D.C., Republicans will block any innovative idea that has a scarlet letter D for Democrat next to it. But in the states run by Democratic governors, we're about solving problems. Every day we work to create jobs and improve access to quality education and expand opportunities for Americans. That's exactly what we've done in Connecticut. We've added over 100,000 jobs while raising the minimum wage. We've passed criminal justice reform that gives non-violent offenders a second chance. We've lowered our prison population by thousands and thousands of individuals while we cut our crime rates the lowest it has been in 48 years. And after the Sandy Hook school tragedy, we passed common sense gun safety laws, including universal background checks in our state of Connecticut. We have moved towards equal pay by making compensation more transparent. And we were the first state in the nation, five years ago, to pass paid sick leave.And guess what? Not only are our workers protecting their health, but they're also protecting the health of the people they serve and overwhelmingly the businesses they work for approve of paid sick leave today. Democratic governors across the country are leading the way:In New York and Delaware, we've raised the minimum wage.In Rhode Island and Montana, we've taken action to fight for equal pay.In Oregon and California, we've passed paid sick leave.Across the map, we have passed Medicaid expansion. And of course, we've made historic investments in education in many states and right here in Pennsylvania under Governor Tom Wolf.Democratic governors and the Democratic Party are focused on the issues that matter to working families. And that's exactly what Hillary Clinton will focus on as our next president.Meanwhile, Donald Trump who has insulted anyone who doesn't agree with him or doesn't look like him -- women, Mexican-Americans, veterans, Muslim-Americans, the LGBT community and people with disabilities. You name them. You name them and Donald Trump has bullied them. Now, I know something about bullies, and I know why we must stand up to them.If Donald Trump's words are bad -- and they are -- his actions are worse. Just look at his vice presidential choice: Gov. Mike Pence. With the Trump-Pence ticket, it's like a contest to see who can discriminate more.Pence rejected $80 million in federal money that would have funded pre-k for 4,000 low-income children. He signed a law that would have forced women to hold funerals for fetuses even in some cases, after a miscarriage. He signed another law that would discriminate against people based on who they love and how they express that. That law cost Indiana's economy an estimated $60 million dollars in lost business. And in another state, North Carolina, a very similar law has caused the NBA to move the All-Star game out of that state.Gov. Pence turned his back on refugee children and their parents. I know this first-hand. The first family of refugees rejected by him are now welcomed residents in the state of Connecticut. The Trump-Pence ticket brings the worst of the Republican gubernatorial record to the national stage, and it shows why we need to fight back at the local level.Governors work where the rubber meets the road Ð where we drive innovative policies that can move across the nation. Democratic governors are critical to winning this battle at the state level. That's why the DGA exists: We're the only organization focused on electing Democratic governors and supporting their policies. We're fighting for these policies today. And we're fighting for the future Ð by focusing on winning back governors' seats before redistricting occurs in 2020.You all know this. You know that the Republicans rigged the map in 2010. That's why we need strong Democratic governors to fight for fair maps and the policies we all believe in and that should be coming out of the Congress of the United States. Together we can Ð and will Ð help lift up every American so that they can live the American dream because we, as Democrats, believe we are stronger together.God bless you, and thank you very much!",1,,,
Elizabeth Warren,"Thank you, Joe, and thank you to Massachusetts for the great honor of serving as your Senator. Wow! What a night. Michelle Obama. Cory Booker. And we still have Bernie coming up. Bernie reminds us what Democrats fight for every day! Thank you, Bernie!We are here tonight because America faces a choice, the choice of a new president.On one side is a man who inherited a fortune from his father and kept it going by cheating people and skipping out on debts. A man who has never sacrificed anything for anyone. A man who cares only for himself Ñ every minute of every day.On the other side is one of the smartest, toughest, most tenacious people on the planet Ñ a woman who fights for children, for women, for health care, for human rights, a woman who fights for all of us, and who is strong enough to win those fights.We're here today because our choice is Hillary Clinton! I'm with Hillary!For me, this choice is personal. It's about who we are as a people. It's about what kind of country we want to be.I grew up in Oklahoma. My daddy ended up as a maintenance man, and my mom worked for minimum wage at Sears. My three brothers served in the military. The oldest was career, 288 combat missions in Vietnam. The second worked construction. The third started his own business. Me? I got married at 19 and graduated from a commuter college in Texas that cost $50 a semester. The way I see it, I'm a janitor's daughter who became a public school teacher, a professor, and a United States Senator. America is truly a country of opportunity!I'm deeply grateful to that America. I believe in that America. But I'm worried. Worried that my story is locked in the past. Worried that opportunity is slipping away for people who work hard and play by the rules.Look around. Americans bust their tails, some working two or three jobs, but wages stay flat. Meanwhile, the basic costs of making it from month to month keep going up. Housing, health care, child care Ñ costs are out of sight. Young people are getting crushed by student loans. Working people are in debt. Seniors can't stretch a Social Security check to cover the basics.And even families who are OK today worry that it could all fall apart tomorrow. This. Is. Not. Right!Here's the thing: America isn't going broke. The stock market is breaking records. Corporate profits are at all-time highs. CEOs make tens of millions of dollars. There's lots of wealth in America, but it isn't trickling down to hard-working families like yours.Does anyone here have a problem with that? Well, I do too.People get it: the system is rigged.So-called experts claim America is in trouble because both political parties in Washington refuse to compromise. Gridlock!That is just flat wrong. Washington works great for those at the top.When giant companies wanted more tax loopholes, Washington got it done. When huge energy companies wanted to tear up our environment, Washington got it done. When enormous Wall Street banks wanted new regulatory loopholes, Washington got it done. No gridlock there!But try to do something, anything, for working people, and you'll have a fight on your hands.Democrats have taken on those fights. Democrats fought to get health insurance for more Americans. Democrats fought for a strong consumer agency so big banks can't cheat people. We fought, we won, and we improved the lives of millions of people Ñ thank you, President Obama!Yes, we won, but Republicans and lobbyists battled us every step of the way. Five years later, that consumer agency has returned $11 billion to families who were cheated. And Republicans? They're still trying to kill it.I'm not someone who thinks Republicans are always wrong and Democrats are always right. There's enough blame to go around. But there is a huge difference between the people fighting for a level playing field, and the people keeping the system rigged.Look at Congress since the Republicans took over. Democrats proposed refinancing student loans. And Republicans? They said no! Democrats proposed ending tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas. And Republicans? They said no! Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage. And Republicans? They said no!To every Republican in Congress who said no: this November, the American people are coming for you!And where was Donald Trump? In all these fights, not once did he lift a finger to help working people. Why would he? His whole life has been about taking advantage of that rigged system. Time after time he preyed on working people, people in debt, people who had fallen on hard times. He's conned them, he's defrauded them, and he's ripped them off.Look at his history. Donald Trump said he was ''excited'' for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap. Donald Trump set up a fake university to make money while cheating people and taking their life savings.Donald Trump goes on, and on, and on, about being a successful businessman, but he filed business bankruptcies six times, always to protect his own money and stick his investors and contractors with the bill. Donald Trump hired plumbers and painters and construction workers to do hard labor for his businesses, then told them to take only a fraction of what he owed or fight his lawyers in court for years.What kind of a man acts like this? What kind of a man roots for the economic crash that cost millions of people their jobs? Their homes? Their life savings? What kind of a man cheats students, cheats investors, cheats workers?I'll tell you what kind of man. A man who must NEVER be President of the United States! And we've got the leaders to make it happen: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine!Donald Trump knows that the American people are angry Ñ a fact so obvious he can see it from the top of Trump Tower. So now he's insisting that he, and he alone, can fix the rigged system.Last week Donald Trump spoke for more than an hour on the biggest stage he's ever had. But other than talking about building a stupid wall, which will NEVER get built, really, did you hear any actual ideas? Did you hear even one solid proposal from Trump for increasing incomes, or improving your kids' education, or creating even one single good-paying job?Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs or for college kids or for seniors, no plans to make ANYTHING great for ANYONE except rich guys like Donald Trump. Just look at his ideas. Donald Trump wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage. Donald Trump wants to roll back financial regulations and turn Wall Street loose to wreck our economy again.And Donald Trump has a tax plan to give multi-millionaires and billionaires like himself an average tax cut of $1.3 million Ñ a year. You're struggling to put your kids through college, and Donald Trump thinks HE needs a million-dollar tax break!Trump's entire campaign is just one more late-night Trump infomercial. Hand over your money, your jobs, your children's future, and The ______Great Trump Hot Air Machine will reveal all the answers. And, for one low, low price, he'll even throw in a goofy hat.And here's the really ugly underside to his pitch. Trump thinks he can win votes by fanning the flames of fear and hatred. By turning neighbor against neighbor. By persuading you that the real problem in America is your fellow Americans Ñ people who don't look like you, or don't talk like you, or don't worship like you. He even picked a vice president famous for trying to make it legal to openly discriminate against gays and lesbians.That's Donald Trump's America. An America of fear and hate. An America where we all break apart. Whites against blacks and Latinos. Christians against Muslims and Jews. Straight against gay. Everyone against immigrants. Race, religion, heritage, gender, the more factions the better.But ask yourself this. When white workers in Ohio are pitted against black workers in North Carolina, or Latino workers in Florida, who really benefits?''Divide and Conquer'' is an old story in America. Doctor Martin Luther King knew it. After his march from Selma to Montgomery, he spoke of how segregation was created to keep people divided. Instead of higher wages for workers, Doctor King described how poor whites in the South were fed Jim Crow, which told a poor white worker that, ''No matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man.'' Racial hatred was part of keeping the powerful on top.And now Trump and his campaign have embraced it all. Racial hatred. Religious bigotry. Attacks on immigrants, on women, on gays. A deceitful and ugly blame game that says, whatever worries you, the answer is to blame that other group, and don't put any energy into making real change.When we turn on each other, bankers can run our economy for Wall Street, oil companies can fight off clean energy, and giant corporations can ship the last good jobs overseas.When we turn on each other, rich guys like Trump can push through more tax breaks for themselves and then we'll never have enough money to support our schools, or rebuild our highways, or invest in our kids' future.When we turn on each other, we can't unite to fight back against a rigged system.Well, I've got news for Donald Trump. The American people are not falling for it! We've seen this ugliness before, and we're not going to be Donald Trump's hate-filled America. Not now, not ever!I come to you as the daughter of a janitor, a daughter who believes in an America of opportunity. The hand of history is on our shoulders. We know how to build a future, a future that works not just for some of our children, but for all of our children. We know, and we must have the courage to make it happen.This is about our values, our shared values with our candidates Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine!We believe that no matter who you are, no matter where you're from, no matter who you love, equal means equal. Hillary will fight to make sure discrimination has no place in America. And we're with her!We believe that no one, no one, who works full time should live in poverty. Hillary will fight for raising the minimum wage, fair scheduling, paid family and medical leave! And we're with her!We believe every kid in America should have a chance for a great education without getting crushed by debt. Hillary will fight for refinancing student loans and debt-free college. And we're with her!We believe that after a lifetime of hard work, seniors should be able to retire with dignity. Hillary will fight to expand Social Security, strengthen Medicare, and protect retirement accounts. And we're with her!We believe that oil companies shouldn't call the shots in Washington, that science matters, that climate change is real. Hillary will fight to preserve this earth for our children and grandchildren. And we're with her!We believe Ð and I can't believe I have to say this in 2016 Ð in equal pay for equal work and a woman's right to control over her own body! Hillary will fight for women. And we're with her!We believe we don't need WEAKER rules on Wall Street, we need stronger rules, and when big banks get too risky, break 'em up. Hillary will fight to hold big banks accountable. And we're with her!We believe that the United States should never, never, sign trade deals that help giant corporations but leave working people in the dirt! Hillary will fight for American workers. And we're with her!And just one more. We believe we must get big money out of politics and root out corruption. Hillary will fight to overturn Citizens United and return this government to the people! And we're with her!If you believe that America must work for all of us, not just the rich and powerful, if you believe we must reject the politics of fear and division, if you believe we are stronger together, then let's work our hearts out to make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States!",1,,,
Jeanne Shaheen,"Thank you delegates! And thank you, Pam Livengood, for sharing your family's story here today. I applaud your courage. Democrats stand with you, your family, and all families struggling with addiction. And President Hillary Clinton will stand with you and we will win this fight together. The opioid and heroin epidemic is ravaging communities all across this country. It's a crisis that affects old and young, rich and poor, men and women, Democrats and Republicans. And it will take all of us working together to defeat it. Across my home state of New Hampshire, the awful toll rose each year -- 192 overdoses in 2013, 326 fatalities in 2014, and 433 fatalities in 2015. These statistics tell the story of a staggering epidemic. But statistics can't fully capture the profound human toll. It's not only thousands of individual lives that have been destroyed, entire communities are being devastated. Hillary Clinton sees the epidemic and it's terrific toll because she came to New Hampshire not to talk but to listen. And she heard stories like Pam Livengood's story. She heard stories like the one I recently heard about a young man full of promise, on his way to college when he suffered a sports injury, got addicted to pain killers, switched to heroin, and now instead of living on the freshman quad, he's living on the streets, panhandling for his next fix. Hillary heard how addicts are being turned away from treatment facilities due to a lack of resources. And Hillary heard from law enforcement stretched to their limit dealing with substance abuse. She knows that drug counselors and police officers and the other incredible people on the front lines of the battle are heroes. They're doing amazing work but they need our help. More than 47,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2014. Hillary Clinton knows we cannot continue on this path. She knows because during this campaign she listened in New Hampshire and across the country. She listened, she learned, and she put together a plan to treat this like the health emergency that it is and to deploy the necessary resources to fight it. Her plan would invest in some very simple goals: Empower communities to prevent drug use among teenagers. Ensure every person suffering from addiction can obtain comprehensive treatment. Ensure that all first responders carry Narcan, which could stop overdoses from becoming fatal. And prioritizing treatment for low level and nonviolent offenses so we can end the era of mass incarceration.Early this year, I introduced an emergency funding bill in the Senate to pay for policing, prevention, treatment, and recovery. But sadly it was defeated by Republicans. Donald Trump certainly doesn't have a plan to deal with this health epidemic that's gripped our country. In fact, Donald Trump doesn't seem to know what's happening outside of Trump Tower and he seems completely uninterested in finding out. How can Trump represent America when he doesn't even take the time to know America? We need a president who listens, who learns, who has empathy, and who wants the same opportunities for all children that she's had, who wants an America where we go forward together. We need President Hillary Clinton!",1,,,
Jeff Merkley,"Hello Philadelphia, and hello Oregon! I am the son of a millwright from a small town in southern Oregon. I was the first of my family to go to college. I live in the same blue collar community I grew up in. And my children go to the same public schools I did. Here is the truth: Donald Trump got rich by taking advantage of Americans like the hard working Oregonians in my community back home. Making his products overseas. Hiring foreign workers instead of Americans for jobs that are right here. Cheating small business contractors, never paying them what he owed. And scamming people out of their savings through his fraudulent university. Where I come from, people like Donald Trump are not the solution; they are the problem. Last week in Cleveland, Donald Trump claimed he was a champion for American workers. But he's never woken up in a day in his life worried about American workers. He is no more a champion for American workers than a lion is a champion for a gazelle. When I talk to folks back home, again and again, I hear the frustrations of people who watch billionaires get richer while they struggle to find a job, struggle to send their kids to college, struggle to make their rent or their mortgage. Our response to these real challenges should not be to blame, to bully, to belittle, but to rise to the moment with real solutions. We owe an enormous debt to Bernie Sanders, speaking of solutions. Bernie Sanders inspired us to reach for bold solutions to the challenges we face. Bernie's leadership on progressive issues, his willingness to fearlessly stand up to the powers that be, have galvanized a grassroots movement that is here tonight and will continue long after November and we need it to continue long after November. And now, together, working together, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have forged the most progressive platform in our party's history. And working together, we need to join their fight for tuition free college for working Americans, for pivoting to 100 percent renewable energy to save our planet from climate change. We need to fight together to overturn Citizens United. We need to fight together for passage of the Equality Act for equal opportunity for LGBTQ Americans. We need to fight together with Bernie and Hillary to end profiling and mass incarceration for our communities of color. And we need to fight for trade policies that put American workers first, which means as Hillary has said, we must say no to bad trade deals and that includes the TPP. Together we must fight for a government of, by and for the people. Not a government for the powerful, not a government for the privileged, but a government for the people. And that is exactly what we're going to do when we follow the vision of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, and we elect her, Hillary Clinton, and Tim Kaine in November. We must must be united in this battle. Whether you spent this year ''feeling the Bern'' or you spent this year ''ready for Hillary'', all of us are ready for an America that rejects discrimination and embraces diversity, that celebrates voter empowerment, not voter suppression, that creates opportunity for all of us not just the lucky few. So let's work together as Bernie and Hillary have and make sure that next January, on the west steps of the Capitol, it is Hillary Clinton that we are celebrating to become the next president of the United States of America. Thank you so much. God bless you and good night. Thank you!",1,,,
Karla Ortiz,"Thank you very much for coming here today. I really appreciate it. And today I'm going to tell you guys a story about my parents, about their deportation of immigration. I'm a daughter of immigrants parents. [] Brave. That's what Hillary Clinton called me when I told her I was worried my parents would be deported. Even when I was little, my parents were always crying. But I didn't understand why.I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. My parents came here looking for a better life, for the American dream.But I don't feel brave every day. On most days I'm scared. I'm scared that at any moment, my mom and my dad will be forced to leave. And I wonder what if I come home and find it empty? I want to see my parents, I want my parents to see me do science experiments and help me find my rare rocks in the desert. I want to grow up to be a lawyer so I can help other families like us. I have hope.Hillary Clinton told me that she would do everything she could to help us. She told me that I don't have to do the worrying, because she will do the worrying for me and all of us. She wants me to have the worries of an 11 year old, not the weight of the world on my shoulder.",1,,,
Kirsten Gillenbrand,"Most of you know me as United States senator from New York. But during school drop off and pick up, I'm better known as Theo and Henry's mom. Like most working parents, my husband and I juggle a lot. We're fortunate to have flexibility. But some days, we still barely keep it together. The vast majority of working parents have it much tougher. They're struggling with too little time, too little money, and too little support. And Washington hasn't caught up to their reality. Families today look almost nothing like they did a generation ago. Eight in 10 moms work outside the homes; four in 10 moms are the primary or sole breadwinners, and many are single. Thanks to marriage equality, more children grow up with two moms or two dads.Yet today, our policies are stuck in the Mad Men era. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn't guarantee workers paid family leave. Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth. Most parents work outside the home, yet child care can cost as much as college tuition. Families rely on women's income but we still don't have equal pay for equal work. This makes no sense because we know that when families are strong, America is strong. Hillary Clinton gets it, not just because she's a working mom and Charlotte and Aiden's grandmother but because for her, it's about her core values -- the idea we have that we have a responsibility to one another. It's who we are as a nation. It's why, after law school, she could have gone to a fancy law firm, but she chose to work at the Children's Defense Fund where she advocated for children with disabilities. It's why, as America's First Lady, she helped create a heath insurance program for children so that eight million kids could get the care they need. And it's why, as Secretary of State, she helped women and children to escape violence and poverty, to attend schools, support their families, and reinvest in their communities. And it's why, as president of the United States, she will bring our workplace policies out of the Dark Ages and always -- always -- put families first. You see, Hillary Clinton's life's work has been defined by one question, ''How can we help those who need it the most?'' Donald Trump has been defined by a very different question, ''How can I help myself the most?'' Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and said that wages are ''too high''. Hillary knows that in the richest country in the world, it is unacceptable that a mom with two kids working full-time still lives in poverty. Donald Trump says that when it comes to paid family leave, you have to ''be careful'' of it. Hillary knows that it's long past time to have guaranteed paid family leave. Donald Trump thinks that women should ''just work harder'' because, and I'm quoting, ''You're going to make the same if you as good of a job.'' Every woman in American knows that is not true. Hillary believes women deserve equal pay for equal pay for equal work. The choice in this election could not be clearer. If you believe in the values that have always made us great, if you believe in keeping America great, then support Hillary Clinton. Thank you and God bless this great nation!",1,,,
Luis Gutierrez,"Hello Philadelphia! You know, my parents grow up in [Spanish audio] in rural Puerto Rico. They weren't educated. They didn't speak English but they didn't even have a winter coat. Barely out of their teens, they came to the U.S., and I was born in the great city of Chicago. My parents were born American citizens. But when they moved along with half a million other Puerto Ricans in the 1950s, they were greeted with scorn and discrimination. Politicians called them criminals. They said my parents were dangerous disease and would ruin the country. Sound familiar to you tonight? Nobody spoke up against the bigotry and hatred my parents endured. So you better believe I'm using my voice against the discrimination we hear today. I will raise my voice against the bigot who thinks a judge born in Indiana can't do his job because his parents were born in Mexico. I will raise my voice against a bully who calls hardworking immigrants criminals and rapists -- someone who promises to round up and deport families -- millions of families -- and then put up a wall between them and us. You have joined me in that fight and so has Hilary Clinton. She stands with us so America remains a welcoming nation. We don't discriminate because of what you look like, who you love, how you pray, what language your parents speak or where you were born. But let's be clear. My parents when they came from Puerto Rico weren't the only ones to confront discrimination. Every generation of newcomers, whoever and wherever they come from -- Latin America, Europe, Africa Asia the Middle East -- they're met with skepticism and suspicion. But every generation proves the skeptics wrong. Immigrants contribute to our communities and make America a great nation. Immigrants die defending our democracy. And you know what? They give our founding principles meaning in our time. Every time immigrants are labeled as them but over time they become a part of us -- ''We the people''. About 11 million undocumented immigrants live, work, pay taxes, and raise their family in the United States of America. A lot of their families include U.S. citizens just like me.But listen, no matter what your family tree looks like, a fair immigration system is better for all of America. No matter what others say, it is simply a fantasy that we're going to round up and deport 11 million people. It's a sick hateful fantasy. But let me tell you what gives me hope. In her heart, Hillary Clinton's dream for America is one where immigrants are allowed to come out of the shadows, get right with the law, pay their taxes and not feel fear that their families are going to be ripped apart. When Hillary Clinton steps to this podium to accept the nomination, we'll all take a giant step forward. The broad and diverse America that fights for an inclusive and fair nation. Our union of black and brown, white and African and Asian people who love the Earth and know that climate change is real and value education. We will all step up to that podium with her. Listen, we continue the work of our heroes like John Lewis and Dolores Huerta, Cesar Chavez and Doctor Martin Luther King, and martyrs like Medgar Evers, who allow me to have the ability to speak from this podium. We fight for equal rights and workers' rights. We believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work in this country. And we will not stand idly by because we believe that Congress has to keep its hands off Planned Parenthood. We believe that people should be able to love who they love and marry who they want to marry in the United States of America. And we believe that when you send your children to school or young people are having fun at a nightclub or you walk a beat as a police officer or you walk down the street in your neighborhood in Chicago, you shouldn't fear being shot. We will take on the NRA with Hillary as president of the United States. Yes, we believe in a country where this son of uneducated parents born in Puerto Rico can speak to this nation on this podium in the city where the United States of America was born. With Hillary, our nation will be greater, better, and stronger.",1,,,
Marty Walsh,"Good evening. Good evening. Thank you, Massachusetts. Thank you. Good evening, delegates. My name is Marty Walsh, and I'm an alcoholic. On April 23, 1995, I hit rock bottom. I woke up with little memory of the night before and even less hope for the days to come. Everybody was losing faith in me. Everybody except my family and the labor movement. I followed my father into the building trades when I was 18-years-old. Labor gave my immigrant family a chance and the labor community got me the help I needed and got me a second chance. Eighteen years later, I became the mayor of Boston -- a city of big dreams and a big heart.As mayor, I worked to get everyone a fair shot and a second chance, whether it's apprenticeships, free community college, or help starting a business. There's no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the champion of American workers needs. She will help workers get the skills, the jobs, and the child care they need to support strong families. She believes in an America that's not just for those with advantages; she believes in an America with those who need a helping hand -- people struggling with addiction, mom's working two jobs, students in debt, seniors struggling to retire, workers facing layoffs, and people like the carpenters and electricians Donald Trump hired but then refused to pay just because he did. We may not have our names in gold outside any buildings that we've worked on, but our sweat, our work, our pride is on the inside of every single one of them. Hillary Clinton knows that. She believes what I learned in my labor family -- we are stronger together. This is our choice. Are we gonna let Donald Trump stiff the working families so he can make more for himself and the people at the top? Or are we going to stick together and build an economy that works for everybody in America? I know where I stand. I stand with the women and men of every race, creed, color, who build this country. And I stand as a living example of Hillary Clinton's vision for an America where everyone gets a fair shot and a second chance to achieve their dreams. That's the America I believe in. That's the America I've lived. And that's why America's working people are going to vote and elect Hillary Clinton our next president. I want to thank you, and God bless the United States of America!",1,,,
Michelle Obama,"Thank you all. Thank you so much. You know, it's hard to believe that it has been eight years since I first came to this convention to talk with you about why I thought my husband should be President. Remember how I told you about his character and conviction, his decency and his grace -Ð the traits that we've seen every day that he's served our country in the White House.I also told you about our daughters Ð- how they are the heart of our hearts, the center of our world. And during our time in the White House, we've had the joy of watching them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women -Ð a journey that started soon after we arrived in Washington, when they set off for their first day at their new school.I will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just seven and ten years old, pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns. And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was, ''What have we done?'' See, because at that moment, I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them.That is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight -- how we urge them to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or faith. How we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don't stoop to their level -Ð no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high. With every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us. We as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as President and First Lady, because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls, but to children across this country Ð- kids who tell us, ''I saw you on TV, I wrote a report on you for school.'' Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with hope, and he wondered, ''Is my hair like yours?'' And make no mistake about it, this November, when we go to the polls, that is what we're deciding -Ð not Democrat or Republican, not left or right. No, this election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives. And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be President of the United States, and that is our friend, Hillary Clinton. See, I trust Hillary to lead this country because I've seen her lifelong devotion to our nation's children Ð- not just her own daughter, who she has raised to perfection Ð- but every child who needs a champion: Kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs. Kids who wonder how they'll ever afford college. Kids whose parents don't speak a word of English but dream of a better life. Kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be.You see, Hillary has spent decades doing the relentless, thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives -- advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer. Fighting for children's health care as First Lady and for quality child care in the Senate. And when she didn't win the nomination eight years ago, she didn't get angry or disillusioned. Hillary did not pack up and go home. Because as a true public servant, Hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointments. So she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as Secretary of State, traveling the globe to keep our kids safe. And look, there were plenty of moments when Hillary could have decided that this work was too hard, that the price of public service was too high, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks or even how she laughs. But here's the thing -- what I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure. She never takes the easy way out. And Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life. And when I think about the kind of President that I want for my girls and all our children, that's what I want. I want someone with the proven strength to persevere. Someone who knows this job and takes it seriously. Someone who understands that the issues a President faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters. Because when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command, you can't make snap decisions. You can't have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out. You need to be steady, and measured, and well-informed. I want a President with a record of public service, someone whose life's work shows our children that we don't chase fame and fortune for ourselves, we fight to give everyone a chance to succeed -- and we give back, even when we're struggling ourselves, because we know that there is always someone worse off, and there but for the grace of God go I. I want a President who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters Ð- a President who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago: That we are all created equal, each a beloved part of the great American story. And when crisis hits, we don't turn against each other -Ð no, we listen to each other. We lean on each other. Because we are always stronger together. And I am here tonight because I know that that is the kind of president that Hillary Clinton will be. And that's why, in this election, I'm with her. You see, Hillary understands that the President is about one thing and one thing only -Ð it's about leaving something better for our kids. That's how we've always moved this country forward Ð- by all of us coming together on behalf of our children -- folks who volunteer to coach that team, to teach that Sunday school class because they know it takes a village. Heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty. Police officers and protestors in Dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe. People who lined up in Orlando to donate blood because it could have been their son, their daughter in that club. Leaders like Tim Kaine -- who show our kids what decency and devotion look like. Leaders like Hillary Clinton, who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling until she finally breaks through, lifting all of us along with her. That is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to this stage tonight , the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves -- and I watch my daughters Ð- two beautiful, intelligent, black young women Ð- playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters Ð- and all our sons and daughters -Ð now take for granted that a woman can be President of the United States. So don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this, right now, is the greatest country on earth. And as my daughters prepare to set out into the world, I want a leader who is worthy of that truth, a leader who is worthy of my girls' promise and all our kids' promise, a leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children. So in this election, we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best. We cannot afford to be tired, or frustrated, or cynical. No, hear me -- between now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago: We need to knock on every door. We need to get out every vote. We need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing Hillary Clinton as President of the United States of America.Let's get to work. Thank you all, and God bless.",1,,,
Nita Lowey,"Good evening. Good evening! It is my pleasure to join you in the City of Brotherly Love to nominate our first sister president. In the United State Congress, I have the privilege to represent teachers and first responders, veterans and college students, small business owners and seniors, and my good friend and colleague, the next president of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton. We, New Yorkers, really know Hillary. Not only has she been our First Lady and Secretary of State, Hillary has been our neighbor, our friend, and for eight years, our fierce ally in the United States Senate. Here's what I learned from working closely with her for many years: Hillary doesn't just fight the tough battles; Hillary wins them! And in the dark days after September 11th, Hillary's leadership on behalf of New York was unsurpassed. She consoled those who lost loved ones. She brought home the assistance to get New York back on its feet. And long after the cameras were gone, Hillary helped secure health care for the police, the firefighters, and EMTs who were sick because they ran towards Ground Zero as everyone else ran away. Hillary represented the diverse needs of the entire state of New York -- fighting to keep VA hospitals and military bases open, helping to get produce from farms to market, and giving small businesses the tools to grow and hire. She was a strong voice for New York state of the art hospitals, our colleges, and universities. Of course, Hillary's achievements reach beyond the Empire State, from her work to support family caregivers to make family planning accessible for every American woman and to help provide eight million American children with health insurance. And she is respected around the world for her skilled diplomacy, impeccable leadership, and advancement of rights for women and girls. Hillary has devoted her life and career to public service and strengthening America's middle class. Now, Donald Trump has devoted his life and career to, well, Donald Trump. Hillary will always put our families first. And that's why on our ballots, we put Hillary first. And now, I am happy to be joined by New York leaders who know Hillary Clinton, who respect Hillary Clinton, and will continue the work to elect Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States!",1,,,
Pam Livengood,"For my 50th birthday, I got a two-year-old. You see my daughter and her boyfriend had a beautiful little boy named Francis, but they got caught up in drugs. It started with the pain medication she was given after Francis was born, and it just got worse. It's hard to explain just how devastating it is to watch your child struggle with substance abuse. I know my daughter love Francis but love wasn't enough to take care of him. I started getting calls from child services, and one day they said Francis would be taken away from my family and put in foster care unless he had family who could take care of him. There was no way we were going to let our grandson end up in foster care. So Francis lived with our husband, John, and I until he was five. His grandfather -- he lives with his grandfather now, who is on disability. And when you're my age, you don't expect to start all over again raising a grandchild.Today my daughter is in treatment, but she has a long road ahead of her. My story isn't unique. This epidemic has devastated communities all over the country. It doesn't discriminate against age, race, gender, or income. It affects all of us. But sometimes it feels like folks in Washington don't hear these stories.Well, last year, Hillary Clinton came to New Hampshire for a roundtable at my work and she asked if addiction has touched any of us. And as I told my story, Hillary listened. She even took notes. And then she did something else we don't see a lot of in Washington -- she took action. She came up with a plan -- one that includes everything from reducing overdoses to expanding access to treatment. To me, that's the kind of leader we need. We need a leader who listens to the voices of ordinary Americans. A leader who listens with compassion and respect. A leader who believes that as Americans we look out for each other. I'm not saying that leader has to be a grandmother, but it sure helps. For me that leader is Hillary Clinton.",1,,,
Raul Grijalva,"I stand here in support of Hillary Clinton, on behalf of the future and in recognition of our proud past. I am reminded today of all the important fights of the past 50 years fought and won by progressive leaders of our party. I came of age admiring Democrats who fought for civil rights, for women's rights, for clean air, clean water and for peace and the many other great investments that's made in this country that made it a better place. I came of age with a party that believes the public good, not the size of a donor's check, was the true measure of an idea. And my friends, a new generation is coming of age today. Millions of young people, all ethnicities, all backgrounds, all income levels are looking for us to stay true to the party's great ideals. They look to us hoping we will put their needs above those of the already rich and the already powerful. Their idealism, their optimism, their belief in America -- they are no different than the idealism that built this nation or the idealism that won progressive fights of generations ago. Their idealism is just as powerful and, yes, just as fragile. In this election and in everything we do, we must remember that and be worthy of it. I wouldn't be here today supporting our nominee if Democrats of 50 years ago hadn't had their courage. I wouldn't be here if our party was built by the likes of Donald Trump who's trying to make our country meaner, hateful, more divided, and more fearful. I'm proud to be -- very proud -- to be a part of a movement that's going to beat Donald Trump, that's going to help elect Hillary Clinton, and that's going to turn that idealism into a government philosophy we can all be proud of. So now it's time. Let's go win this. Let's win it for our people and let's win it for our nation. Thank you.",1,,,
Sarah Silverman,"As many of you may know, I support Bernie Sanders and the movement behind him. And Bernie's already succeeded in so many ways. He proved that Citizens United is in fact not a necessary evil. And by the way, Citizens United -- isn't that such a beautiful name for something that means billionaires buying politicians? Good lord. Rails against the very spirit of our democracy. And I'm very glad that Hillary has vowed to overturn it. Not only did Bernie wake us up, he made us understand what is possible and what we deserve. You know, my shrink says ''We don't what we want; we get what we think we deserve.'' And Bernie showed us that all of America's citizens deserve quality health care and education, not just the wealthy elite. I know. That sounds so obvious. Who wouldn't agree with that? But yet it's not what's been happening. You know, I happen to believe the crazy notion that people who may be weren't born with the same opportunities as you and me should be given the same opportunity as you and me. And all it takes to accomplish this is everyone. It's all of us. Or as a pretty kick ass woman once said, ''It takes a village.'' This Democratic primary was exemplary. No name-calling. No comments about the size of candidate's hands or ethnicity or how much they sweat or if they go to the bathroom. Inside secret -- they do. That stuff is for third graders. Come on. That's like major arrested development stuff. That's ''I'm still emotionally four and calling people names from my gold encrusted sandbox because I was given money instead of human touch or coping tools'' stuff. But I digressHillary heard the passion of the people -- the people behind Bernie and brought those passions into the party's platform and that is the process of democracy at its very best and it's very cool to see. Hillary is our Democratic nominee and I will proudly vote for her. It's so inspiring. It's so inspiring. Just a few years ago, she was a secretary and now she's going to be president. I mean, come on. She's like the only person ever to be over-qualified for a job as the president. So I tell you this. I will vote for Hillary with gusto as I continue to be inspired and moved to action by the ideals set forth by Bernie, who will never stop fighting for us. I am proud to be a part of Bernie's movement and a vital part of that movement is making absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton is our next president of the United States. Booyah, papa boo-yee!To the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous",1,,,
Amy Klobuchar,"Hello, friends. Hello, Democrats. I'm here to make the case for a leader who, as you just saw, is focused on security -- security for our country, security for our economy and our democracy. A leader who knows we are all more secure when women and girls have the opportunity to lead with their heads high and their strides strong. That leader is Hillary Clinton.She sees a world where girls are not captured and sold but are fearless and bold, where they lead and not follow, and where when someone tells a young woman, ''You fight like a girl'', her answer is, ''Yes, I do, and I'm proud to be that girl!''Now, delegates, here is one challenge. Today, millions of people in the world are held in forced labor or sexual servitude. Human trafficking hits home for me. I'm a former prosecutor. A few years ago in Minnesota, a 12-year-old girl got a text to go to a party. A man picked her up in a parking lot and raped her. She ended up in a hotel and was forced to take explicit pictures of herself. They were posted online, and then she was sold to two more men.They got that guy. Our Justice Department and law enforcement went after him. Last December, he was convicted by a jury.She was 12 years old. Not old enough to drive a car or go to her high school prom. Not old enough to vote. This is happening in our own country.That's why, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton took the international report on trafficking -- the one nations use to improve their prosecutions and she made our country accountable. She added the United States of America to that list because she knows that if we are going to be a beacon for the world, then we have to get our own house in order.And when Hillary said, ''Human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights'', she named sex trafficking as a violation of those rights. She didn't say it just anywhere, my fellow delegates, she said it in China. She came home from Beijing and she supported the first trafficking law in our country. And years later, she supported my bipartisan bill that's helping law enforcement crack down on trafficking and make sure that kids who are trafficked are treated as the victims that they are and not as criminals.Fellow delegates, human trafficking is the third biggest criminal enterprise in the world. As long as ISIS is selling girls for $165 and parents in Nigeria are left with nothing but bows and arrows to chase the terrorists who steal their daughters in the middle of the night, we will never have a just and good world.Because when women are held back, democracies falter. When women are bound and treated as sex slaves, tyrants rule. Opportunity for women is not a sign of a country's weakness; it is a sign of a nation's strength. Or maybe, just maybeMark Twain said it best. ''What would men be without women? Scarce, sir, mighty scarce.'' Elevating women across the world so they're treated with dignity and respect, that's what Hillary Clinton will do. And if that means playing the woman card, Donald Trump, let me tell you, there are hundreds of millions of women in this world who are ready to play that card. And in the United States of America, it's called the voting card. You know, part of how we make this better is by telling the truth -- laying out the facts and sharing our stories. Here with us tonight is someone who has experienced the devastation of human trafficking. It is hard to put into words the horrors she's faced, but Ima Matul has the courage to speak out. We all have a voice. This election, let's use it. We welcome you to the stage, Ima.",2,,,
Barbara Boxer,"You look beautiful out there! So I have a question: Are you ready to elect the very first women president of these United States of America? Let me hear it! Yes! I want to talk to you very personally, because I've known Hillary Clinton for more than 20 years. We're actually family. My daughter was married to her brother, so my beloved grandson is her beloved nephew. Yes. So I know her. I know her as the loving aunt who helped plan my grandson's birthday parties when he was still just a little toddler. And I saw her rush over after a busy day at the State Department to cheer him on at his high school football games. And she was often joined by her devoted mother, Dorothy, who overcame a painful childhood and taught Hillary how one caring person can make a change in a child's life. Dorothy once wrote me a letter and she said this, ''I can't remember when Hillary didn't take the long view of things, never instant gratification.'' And she wrote ''That strong sense of empathy for others and at great sense of humor have served her well.'' Now, that's a mom who knew her daughter well. Now, we saw Hillary's heart -- her heart -- when as First Lady she worked across party lines to bring healthcare to millions and millions of children. We saw her strength when after 9/11 she stood with first responders and tirelessly fought for them. We saw her strength and we saw her leadership when as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton restored America's standing in the world. You remember that! After the Bush administration. And I personally saw the light in her eyes when she became a grandmother and her fight for a better America became even more personal and even more urgent. Now, during this campaign, we have seen something else -- her toughness. And I know a little bit about toughness. Now, the right wing has thrown everything at Hillary, not only they kitchen sink, not only the stove but the refrigerator and the toasters too. And you know what? She's still standing. They've thrown everything at her, and she's still standing! America's families need Hillary in the White House standing with all of us. We need a president who knows it's just plain wrong that women make 79 cents for every dollar paid to a man, and yet her opponent refused to support equal pay. He says -- quote -- ''the marketplace is going to make sure of it''. Well it's 2016, and we're still waiting, Mr. Trump. We can count on Hillary to fight to raise the minimum wage. Her opponent says wages are too high. Now, that's un-American because in our great country if you work full time, you should never ever have to live in poverty. We can count on Hillary. We can count on Hillary to protect our right to choose. Her opponents said a woman should be punished for exercising her right to choose and then picked a running mate who believes Roe v. Wade belongs to -- quote him -- ''in the ash heap of history''. Well, I have that message for Donald Trump and Mike Pence: We are not going back to the dark days when women died and back alleys. We are never, ever, ever going back! Never! We are moving forward with Hillary Clinton. You know, there's a lot of talk about what makes America great. Well, I'll tell you this. It's not when we insult each other. It's not when we tear each other down. It's when we stand together. It's when we work together. It's when we build together. It's when we fight together. And that's what makes America great. And that's what Hillary Clinton will do. And that is why I'm telling you tonight, Hillary Clinton will be our next president of the United States of America! Thank you, California! Thank you, America. Thank you!",2,,,
Barbara Mikulski,"Fellow Democrats and sister Democrats and a special hello to the state of Maryland! Our nation was born here in Philadelphia 240 years ago. Our founding fathers gave us the great start, but it was the founding mothers who said, ''Do not forget the ladies for we will ferment our revolution.'' They started the job, but we're going to keep it going. Now, yes, we do break barriers. I broke a barrier when I became the first Democratic woman elected in the Senate in her own right and the first to chair the powerful Appropriations Committee. So, it is with a full heart that I'm here today as we nominate Hillary Clinton to be the first woman president. Many of you have broken barriers. You were the first to go to college. You were the first to start a business. Maybe the first to be a citizen. But when you know when you broke a barrier, you didn't do it for yourself. You did it for so others who would not have barriers, only opportunities. That's what Hillary wants to do. She wants to break your barriers to opportunities so you won't have barriers. You can count on her. She will work for you. Some people want your rent, but Hillary wants to get results. She'll fight for your day to day needs and the long range needs of the country. She'll fight for the macro issues and those macaroni and cheese issues. So, you'll have national security and economic security. So you'll have an opportunity for a good job and a good neighborhood with a good school, and your kids will have a really good future. So you will have equal pay for equal work. Living wages. So for healthcare when you need it. So, yes, it's about the new jobs and solar energy, but it's so much -- she wants that job to light up your home, light up your community, light up your life. And she wants that little light in you just to shine. I know that Hillary listens. The Hillary I work with is duty-driven, unflagging and unflinching. She's a leader, so on behalf of all the women who've broken down barriers for others and with an eye towards the barriers ahead, I proudly praise Hillary Clinton's name in nomination to be the next president.",2,,,
Bill Clinton,"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!In the spring of 1971 I met a girl.The first time I saw her we were, appropriately enough, in a class on political and civil rights. She had thick blond hair, big glasses, wore no makeup, and she had a sense of strength and self- possession that I found magnetic. After the class I followed her out, intending to introduce myself. I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn't do it. Somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop.And I saw her several more times in the next few days, but I still didn't speak to her. Then one night I was in the law library talking to a classmate who wanted me to join the Yale Law Journal. He said it would guarantee me a job in a big firm or a clerkship with a federal judge. I really wasn't interested, I just wanted to go home to Arkansas.Then I saw the girl again, standing at the opposite end of that long room. Finally she was staring back at me, so I watched her. She closed her book, put it down and started walking toward me. She walked the whole length of the library, came up to me and said, look, if you're going to keep staring at meand now I'm staring back, we at least ought to know each other's name. I'm Hillary Rodham, who are you?I was so impressed and surprised that, whether you believe it or not, momentarily I was speechless.Finally, I sort of blurted out my name and we exchanged a few words and then she went away.Well, I didn't join the Law Review, but I did leave that library with a whole new goal in mind.A couple of days later, I saw her again. I remember, she was wearing a long, white, flowery skirt. And I went up to her and she said she was going to register for classes for the next term. And I said I'd go, too. And we stood in line and talked -- you had to do that to register back then -- and I thought I was doing pretty well until we got to the front of the line and the registrar looked up and said, Bill, what are you doing here, you registered morning?I turned red and she laughed that big laugh of hers. And I thought, well, heck, since my cover's been blown I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the art museum.We've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since.And we've done it in good times and bad, through joy and heartbreak. We cried together this morning on the news that our good friend and a lot of your good friend, Mark Weiner, passed away early this morning.We've built up a lifetime of memories. After the first month and that first walk, I actually drove her home to Park Ridge, Illinoisto meet her family and see the town where she grew up, a perfect example of post World War II middle-class America, street after street of nice houses, great schools, good parks, a big public swimming pool, and almost all white.I really liked her family. Her crusty, conservative father, her rambunctious brothers, all extolling the virtues of rooting for the Bears and the Cuba.And for the people from Illinois here, they even told me what ''waiting for next year'' meant.It could be next year, guys.Now, her mother was different. She was more liberal than the boys. And she had a childhood that made mine look like a piece of cake. She was easy to underestimate with her soft manner and she reminded me all over again of the truth of that old saying you should never judge a book by its covers. Knowing her was one of the greatest gifts Hillary ever gave me.I learned that Hillary got her introduction to social justice through her Methodist youth minister, Don Jones. He took her downtown to Chicago to hear Dr. Martin Luther King speak and he remained her friend for the rest of his life. This will be the only campaign of hers he ever missed.When she got to college, her support for civil rights, her opposition to the Vietnam War compelled her to change party, to become a Democrat.And then between college and law school on a total lark she went alone to Alaska and spent some time sliming fish.More to the point, by the time I met her she had already been involved in the law school's legal services project and she had been influenced by Marian Wright Edelman.She took a summer internship interviewing workers in migrant camps for Senator Walter Mondale's subcommittee.She had also begun working in the Yale New Haven Hospital to develop procedures to handle suspected child abuse cases. She got so involved in children's issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and the futures of poor children.So she was already determined to figure out how to make things better.Hillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by private citizens. In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama to visit one of those segregated academies that then enrolled over half-a-million white kids in the South. The only way the economics worked is if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled. She got sent to prove they weren't.So she sauntered into one of these academies all by herself, pretending to be a housewife that had just moved to town and needed to find a school for her son. And they exchanged pleasantries and finally she said, look, let's just get to the bottom line here, if I enroll my son in this school will he be in a segregated school, yes or know? And the guy said absolutely. She had him!I've seen it a thousand times since. And she went back and her encounter was part of a report that gave Marian Wright Edelman the ammunition she needed to keep working to force the Nixon administration to take those tax exemptions away and give our kids access to an equal education.Then she went down to south Texas where she metshe met one of the nicest fellows I ever met, the wonderful union leader Franklin Garcia, and he helped her register Mexican- American voters. I think some of them are still around to vote for her in 2016.Then in our last year in law school, Hillary kept up this work. She went to South Carolina to see why so many youngshe went to South Carolina to see why so many young African- American boys, I mean, young teenagers, were being jailed for years with adults in men's prisons. And she filed a report on that, which led to some changes, too. Always making things better. Now, meanwhile, let's get back to business. I was trying to convince her to marry me.I first proposed to her on a trip to Great Britain, the first time she had been overseas. And we were on the shoreline of this wonderful little lake, Lake Ennerdale. I asked her to marry me and she said I can't do it.So in 1974 I went home to teach in the law school and Hillary moved to Massachusettsto keep working on children's issues. This time trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the Census weren't enrolled in school. She found one of them sitting alone on her porch in a wheelchair. Once more, she filed a report about these kids, and that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public education.You saw the results of that last night when Anastasia Somoza talked.She never made fun of people with disabilities; she tried to empower them based on their abilities.Meanwhile, I was still trying to get her to marry me.So the second time I tried a different tack. I said I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn't do it.And she smiled and looked at me, like, what is this boy up to? She said that is not a very good sales pitch. I said I know, but it's true. And I meant it, it was true.I said I know most of the young Democrats our age who want to go into politics, they mean well and they speak well, but none of them is as good as you are at actually doing things to make positive changes in people's lives. So I suggested she go home to Illinois or move to New York and look for a chance to run for office. She just laughed and said, are you out of you mind, nobody would ever vote for me.So I finally got her to visit me in Arkansas.And when she did, the people at the law school were so impressed they offered a teaching position. And she decided to take a huge chance. She moved to a strange place, more rural, more culturally conservative than anyplace she had ever been, where she knew good and well people would wonder what in the world she was like and whether they could or should accept her.Didn't take them long to find out what she was like. She loved her teaching and she got frustrated when one of her students said, well, what do you expect, I'm just from Arkansas. She said, don't tell me that, you're as smart as anybody, you've just got to believe in yourself and work hard and set high goals. She believed that anybody could make it.She also started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas, providing legal aid services to poor people who couldn't pay for them. And one day I was driving her to the airport to fly back to Chicago when we passed this little brick house that had a for sale sign on it. And she said, boy, that's a pretty house. It had 1,100 square feet, an attic, fan and no air conditioner in hot Arkansas, and a screened-in porch.Hillary commented on what a uniquely designed and beautiful house it was. So I took a big chance. I bought the house. My mortgage was $175 a month.When she came back, I picked up her up and I said, you remember that house you liked? She said yeah. I said, while you were gone I bought it, you have to marry me now.The third time was the charm.We were married in that little house on October the 11th, 1975. I married my best friend. I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart and strong and loving and caring she was. And I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret.A little over a year later we moved to Little Rock when I became attorney general and she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. Soon after, she started a group called the Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children.It's a group, as you can hear, is still active today.In 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide. It was a big deal then, highly controversial and very important.And I got the feeling that what she did for the rest of her life she was doing there. She just went out and figured out what needed to be done and what made the most sense and what would help the most people. And then if it was controversial she'd just try to persuade people it was the right thing to do.It wasn't the only big thing that happened that spring my first year as governor. We found out we were going to be parents.And time passed. On February 27th, 1980, 15 minutes after I got home from the National Governors Conference in Washington, Hillary's water broke and off we went to the hospital. Chelsea was born just before midnight.And it was the greatest moment of my life. The miracle of a new beginning. The hole it filled for me because my own father died before I was born, and the absolute conviction that my daughter had the best mother in the whole world.For the next 17 years, through nursing school, Montessori, kindergarten, through T-ball, softball, soccer, volleyball and her passion for ballet, through sleepovers, summer camps, family vacations and Chelsea's own very ambitious excursions, from Halloween parties in the neighborhood, to a Viennese waltz gala in the White House, Hillary first and foremost was a mother.She became, as she often said, our family's designated worrier, born with an extra responsibility gene. The truth is we rarely disagreed on parenting, although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple of days off with Chelsea to watch all six ''Police Academy'' movies back-to-back.When Chelsea was 9 months old, I was defeated for reelection in the Reagan landslide. And I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country. We only had two-year terms back then.Hillary was great. Immediately she said, OK, what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do, we're going to get a house, you're going to get a job, we're going to enjoy being Chelsea's parents. And if you really want to run again, you've got to go out and talk to people and figure out why you lost, tell people you got the message and show them you've still got good ideas.I followed her advice. Within two days we had a house, I soon had a job. We had two fabulous years with Chelsea. And in 1982, I became the first governor in the history of our state to be elected, defeated and elected again.I think my experience is it's a pretty good thing to follow her advice. The rest of the decade sort of flew by as our lives settled into a rhythm of family and work and friends.In 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for us as a part of and in response to a court order to equalize school funding and a report by a national expert that said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America.Typical Hillary, she held listening tours in all 75 counties with our committee. She came up with really ambitious recommendations. For example, that we be the first state in America to require elementary counselors in every school because so many kids were having trouble at home and they needed it.So I called the legislature into session hoping to pass the standards, pass a pay raise for teachers and raise the sales tax to pay for it all. I knew it would be hard to pass, but it got easier after Hillary testified before the education committee and the chairman, a plainspoken farmer, said looks to me like we elected the wrong Clinton.Well, by the time I ran for president nine years later, the same expert who said that we had the worst schools in America said that our state was one of the two most improved states in America. And that's because of those standards that Hillary developed. Now, two years later, Hillary told me about a preschool program developed in Israel called HIPPY, Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. The idea was to teach low-income parents, even those that couldn't read, to be their children's first teachers.She said she thought it would work in Arkansas. I said that's great, what are we going to do about it? She said, oh, I already did it. I called the woman who started the program in Israel, she'll be here in about 10 days and help us get started.Next thing you know I'm being dragged around to all these little preschool graduations. Now, keep in mind, this was before any state even had universal kindergarten and I'm being dragged to preschool graduations watching these poor parents with tears in their eyes because they never thought they'd be able to help their kids learn.Now, 20 years of research has shown how well this program works to improve readiness for school and academic achievement. There are a lot of young adults in America who have no idea Hillary had anything to do with it who are enjoying better lives because they were in that program.She did all this while being a full-time worker, a mother and enjoying our life. Why? Well, she's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life.Look, this is a really important point. This is a really important point for you to take out of this convention. If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people's lives are better, you know it's hard and some people think it's boring. Speeches like this are fun.Actually doing the work is hard. So people say, well, we need to change. She's been around a long time, she sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better.I can tell you this. If you were sitting where I'm sitting and you heard what I have heard at every dinner conversation, every lunch conversation, on every lone walk, you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is.When I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural to head the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one. The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance.In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids. There are a lot of other things in that bill that she got done piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.In 1997, she also teamed with the House Minority Leader Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked me more than any of Newt Gingrich's crowd. They worked on a bill together to increase adoptions of children under foster care. She wanted to do it because she knew that Tom DeLay, for all of our differences, was an adoptive parent and she honored him for doing that.Now, the bill they worked on, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, led to a big increase in the adoption of children out of foster care, including non-infant kids and special-needs kids. It made life better because she's a change-maker, that's what she does.Now, when you're doing all this, real life doesn't stop. 1997 was the year Chelsea finished high school and went to college. We were happy for her, but sad for us to see her go. I'll never forget moving her into her dorm room at Stanford. It would have been a great little reality flick. There I was in a trance just staring out the window trying not to cry, and there was Hillary on her hands and knees desperately looking for one more drawer to put that liner paper in.Finally, Chelsea took charge and told us ever so gently that it was time for us to go. So we closed a big chapter in the most important work of our lives. As you'll see Thursday night when Chelsea speaks, Hillary's done a pretty fine job of being a mother.And as you saw last night, beyond a shadow of a doubt so has Michelle Obama.Now, fast forward. In 1999, Congressman Charlie Rangel and other New York Democrats urged Hillaryurged Hillary to run for the seat of retiring Senator Pat Moynihan. We had always intended to go to New York after I left office and commute to Arkansas, but this had never occurred to either one of us. Hillary had never run for office before, but she decided to give it a try.She began her campaign the way she always does new things, by listening and and learning. And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy.And she didn't let him down. Her early years were dominated by 9/11, by working to fund the recovery, then monitoring the health and providing compensation to victims and first and second responders. She and Senator Schumer were tireless and so were our House members.In 2003, partly spurred on by what we were going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee.So she tried to make sure people on the battlefield had proper equipment. She tried to expand and did expand health care coverage to Reservists and members of the National Guard. She got longer family leave, working with Senator Dodd, for people caring for wounded service members.And she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury. She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges. Newt Gingrich was on that commission, he told me what a good job she had done.I say that because nobody who has seriously dealt with the men and women in today's military believes they are a disaster. They are a national treasure of all races, all religions, all walks of life.Now, meanwhile, she compiled a really solid record, totally progressive on economic and social issues. She voted for and against some proposed trade deals. She became the de facto economic development officer for the area of New York outside the ambit of New York City.She worked for farmers, for winemakers, for small businesses and manufacturers, for upstate cities in rural areas who needed more ideas and more new investment to create good jobs, something we have to do again in small-town and rural America, in neighborhoods that have been left behind in our cities and Indian country and, yes, in coal country.When she lost a hard-fought contest to President Obama in 2008, she worked for his election hard. But she hesitated to say yes when he asked her to join his Cabinet because she so loved being a senator from New York.So like me, in a different context, he had to keep asking.But as we all saw and heard from Madeleine Albright, it was worth the effort and worth the wait. As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. And in what The Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them. Her team negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and reestablish inspections. And she got enough Republican support to get two-thirds of the Senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty.She flew all night long from Cambodia to the Middle East to get a cease-fire that would avoid a full-out shooting war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza to protect the peace of the region.She backed President Obama's decision to go after Osama bin Laden.She launched a team, this is really important today, she launched a team to fight back against terrorists online and built a new global counterterrorism effort.We've got to win this battle in the mind field.She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy.She negotiated the first agreement ever -- ever -- where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions. And as she had been doing since she went to Beijing in 1995 and said women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rightsshe worked to empower women and girls around the world and to make the same exact declaration on behalf of the LGBT community in America and around the world.And nobody ever talks about this much, nobody ever talks about this much, but it's important to me. She tripled the number of people with AIDS in poor countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars, most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it didn't cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more.Now, you don't know any of these people. You don't know any of those 3.4 million people, but I'll guarantee you they know you. They know you because they see you as thinking their lives matter. They know you and that's one reason the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it.Now, how does this square? How did this square with the things that you heard at the Republican convention? What's the difference in what I told you and what they said? How do you square it? You can't. One is real, the other is made up.You just have to decide. You just have to decide which is which, my fellow Americans.The real one had done more positive change-making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office.The real one, if you saw her friend Betsy Ebeling vote for Illinois todayhas friends from childhood through Arkansas, where she has not lived in more than 20 years, who have gone all across America at their own expense to fight for the person they know.The real one has earned the loyalty, the respect and the fervent support of people who have worked with her in every stage of her life, including leaders around the world who know her to be able, straightforward and completely trustworthy.The real one calls you when you're sick, when your kid's in trouble or when there's a death in the family.The real one repeatedly drew praise from prominent Republicans when she was a senator and secretary of state.So what's up with it? Well, if you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car paradea real change-maker represents a real threat.So your only option is to create a cartoon, a cartoon alternative, then run against the cartoon. Cartoons are two- dimensional, they're easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard. And a lot of people even think it's boring.Good for you, because earlier today you nominated the real one.Listen, we've got to get back on schedule. You guys calm down.Look (INAUDIBLE) a long, full, blessed life, it really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971. When I was president, I worked hard to give you more peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out.But for this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face. And she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known.You could drop her into any trouble spot, pick one, come back in a month and somehow, some way she will have made it better. That is just who she is.There are clear, achievable, affordable responses to our challenges. But we won't get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election. That's why you should elect her. And you should elect her because she'll never quit when the going gets tough. She'll never quit on you.She sent me in this primary to West Virginia where she knew we were going to lose, to look those coal miners in the eye and say I'm down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back you had 50 years ago, have at it, vote for whoever you want to. But if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America's future.And so I say to you, if you love this country, you're working hard, you're paying taxes and you're obeying the law and you'd like to become a citizen, you should choose immigration reform over somebody that wants to send you back. If you're a Muslim and you love America and freedom and you hate terror, stay here and help us win and make a future together. We want you.If you're a young African American disillusioned and afraid, we saw in Dallas how great our police officers can be, help us build a future where nobody is afraid to walk outside, including the people that wear blue to protect our future.Hillary will make us stronger together. You know it because she's spent a lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to care more about our children and grandchildren. The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on earth we have always been about tomorrow. You children and grandchildren will bless you forever if you do.God bless you. Thank you.",2,,,
Bonnie Watson Coleman,"Hi, I am Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and I come from the great state of New Jersey. House Democrats believe that America is strongest when we have an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top. If you are willing to work hard in our country, you deserve a secure financial future and a strong foothold on the American dream -- buying a home, sending children to college, and real retirement security. We should be creating jobs by upgrading our roads, bridges, broadbands, transit systems, energy grids, and water infrastructures. And we can pay for this progress by closing loopholes and making big corporations pay their fair share. Democrats, led by Hillary Clinton, know that we must make college more affordable and lift the crushing burden of student debt that weighs on the futures of many young Americans and their families. America is stronger when everyone has a chance to succeed.",2,,,
Cecile Richards,"Planned Parenthood was founded 100 years ago, giving women the care they need to live their lives and chase their dreams. No limits, no ceilings. And a century later an enormous ceiling is coming down. But this year isn't just about electing the first woman president; it's about electing this woman president. Each year, millions of women, men and young people trust Planned Parenthood and the Planned Parent Action Fund trusts Hillary Clinton. As First Lady, Hillary declared to the world that women's rights are human rights. She worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program which now covers 8 million kids. As Secretary of State, she was a champion for women and girls around the globe. And she will always stand up for the right of every woman to access a full range of reproductive health care, including abortion, no matter her economic status. Over the last year, Hillary has traveled across our country listening to young activists working to end campus sexual assault. She's listened to fathers who want their daughters to be paid equally to their sons and to parents who need paid family leave and affordable child care. And she has made their fights her own. And she's chosen as her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine -- absolutely -- a man who has been a champion for women and families his entire lifetime. Hillary has always been in Planned Parenthood's corner because she knows women deserve someone who is in theirs. Women like Dana Ferris Fisher [sp]; she's a mom in Dallas who was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Today, Dana is cancer free. And she says she couldn't have done it without Vivian [sp], the Planned Parenthood clinician, who stuck with her all the way through treatment. So, when Donald Trump and Mike Pence say they'll de-fund Planned Parenthood, they're talking about cutting women like Dana off of life saving care. So make no mistake about it, women's health and rights are on the line and on the ballot this election. So, you may have heard that just last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the Texas laws that forced abortion providers to close their doors are dangerous and they are unconstitutional. But the fight's not over. Donald Trump has pledged to appoint justices who will overturn Roe vs. Wade and undo decades of progress. His policies aren't just frightening; they're rooted in a deeply, disturbing world view. Donald Trump has called women fat pigs and dogs. He wants to punish women for having abortions. And he says pregnancy is ''an inconvenience for a women's employer''. Well, Mr. Trump come this November, women are going to be a lot more than an inconvenience. Yep, because women are going to be the reason you are not elected to be president. When my great grandmother was growing up, women couldn't vote under Texas law. And just two generations later her granddaughter, my mom, Ann Richards, was elected governor of the state of Texas. And tonight, tonight we are closer than ever to putting a woman in the White House. And I could almost hear mom saying, ''Well, it sure took ya'll long enough.'' So what do you say? Are you ready to make history? Let's go win this election. Thank you!",2,,,

We will fight Republican attempts to weaken Social Security. Hillary Clinton stands with us, and we stand with her on every one of these commitments. Together, we will build a stronger America for our families.",2,,,
Eric Holder,"I have known Hillary Clinton for almost 25 years, as a friend, a colleague, and a leader of courage and conviction. And today, I'm proud to say ''I'm with Her!'' because I've seen that she has the skills to serve as commander in chief and the strength to lead our already-great nation in this hour of challenge and consequence.Now, did you hear what I just said?Already great nation. Donald did you hear me? Already great nation.At a time when the bonds between law enforcement and communities of color have frayed when assassins target police in heinous attacks, and peaceful citizens have to question whether black lives truly matter -- and they do -- we need a president who understands the reality that I saw in my travels across the country as our nation's 82nd Attorney General -- that there should be no tension between protecting those who valiantly risk their lives to serve and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly by the police.Now, as the brother of a retired police officer, I am profoundly aware that an attack on a police officer anywhere is an attack on our entire society. So it is not enough for us to praise law enforcement officers after they are killed. We must protect them, value them and equip them with the right tools, tactics, and training, while they are still alive. We must also come to realize that keeping our officers safe is not inconsistent with ensuring that those in law enforcement treat the people they are sworn to serve with dignity, with respect, and with fairness. We must commit ourselves to both goals.Hillary understands that the goals we share are the same -- safer communities with less crime, where all our loved ones, police and community residents, they get the chance to come home at night. As president, she will continue the work that needs to be done to rebuild trust, because she knows that we are stronger together.But let us be honest, at a time when our justice system is out of balance, when one in three black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes, and when black defendants in the federal system receive sentences 20 percent longer than their white peers, we need a president who will end this policy of over-incarceration. Now, as Attorney General, I launched sweeping reforms of our federal criminal justice system and reduced its reliance on draconian mandatory minimum sentences. And as a result, we cut the federal prison population and the crime rate -- together -- for the first time in more than 40 years.Now, that's right. That's right. Despite the fiction and the fear-mongering you've heard from the other party's nominee, violent crime has gone down since President Obama took office.As president, Hillary will go even farther. She fought, as a senator, against sentencing disparities and racial profiling. She used her first major speech as a candidate to lay out a bold vision for criminal justice reform. As a presidential candidate, she has talked about systemic racism in a way that no one else has. And she will help our nation summon the courage to confront racial injustice and face down the legacies of our darkest past.Now, finally, at a time when the right to vote is under siege, when Republicans brazenly assault the most fundamental right of our democracy passing laws designed to stop people from voting while closing locations in minority neighborhoods where people get the documents they need to vote, we need a president sensitive to these echoes of Jim Crow.We need a president who holds the right to vote as sacred and stands firm against any kind of modern day poll tax. My fellow Americans, Hillary Clinton will be that president. She will set a new standard for early voting. She will champion universal automatic registration. You turn 18; you're registered to vote. Because she knows, she knows -- and everybody in this arena has to know this -- the best way to defend the right to vote is by exercising it. Throughout history, too many people have sacrificed too much, fought wars, and braved fire hoses, dogs, bullets, and bombs for this generation to sit on the sidelines. Never forget that we are heirs to a revolution that began just five miles from where we gather this week and that the choice we face in this pivotal election is about much more than politics. It's about the arc that we are on as a nation. The composition of our character as a people and the ideals of equality, opportunity, and justice that have always made America great. These are the ideals for which Hillary Clinton has fought her entire life. This is the fight that she will continue to win when we make history by electing her the 45th president of the United States of America. Thank you! ",2,,,
Ima Matul,"Thank you, senator, for your words and your work. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that I would share a stage with so many leaders and visionaries. I grew up in a poor village in Indonesia. When I was 17-years-old, I was brought to Los Angeles with the promise of a job as a nanny. Instead, I spent the next three years in domestic servitude being abused. When I finally had the courage to escape my trafficker, I found a home at the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking. After I got the support I needed, I found the strength to organize survivors from across the country. Before human trafficking began to capture our attention, before there were laws to identify and protect victims, even before I escaped my trafficker, Hillary Clinton was fighting to end modern slavery. And throughout her career, Hillary kept up the fight. Human trafficking is not just happening overseas; it is happening right here in our backyard. Every day I hear stories just like my own. Still, I have hope. There is a growing awareness about the devastating impact of human trafficking. There is growing embrace of survivors in our communities and businesses and churches. And there's growing commitment to finding innovative solutions to make sure this generation of survivors will be the last. I have hope -- especially that Hillary Clinton is becoming president! As a survivor and an advocate, I have hope that we can end human trafficking. Thank you.",2,,,
Jan Schakowsky,"Good evening. I'm Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. Thank you. From Illinois, the birthplace of Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton and House Democrats believe a stronger America means protecting women's rights and expanding women's opportunities. Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have other priorities -- meddling in women's most intimate decisions, jeopardizing women's health, even criminalizing women's choices.When it comes to the issues between women and their doctors, House Republicans misrepresent; they intimidate and they undermine. In this Congress alone, they have voted 14 times to attack women's health. Republicans continue to attack the Affordable Care Act, while it provides newfound health security to millions of Americans. Because of health care reform, no longer can insurance companies charge you more just because you're a woman. And for the first time in history, no longer is being a woman a pre-existing condition. Democrats are fighting back against the Republican anti-woman crusade. It's 2016 and American women are not going back. We are moving forward!",2,,,
Joe Crowley,"It was a beautiful day. Not a cloud in the sky. It was just after 9:00 a.m., and I was waiting on the runway at LaGuardia to fly back to Washington. Then I got the news: Two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center. I raced out of the terminal. I tried calling my two cousins, both members of the New York City Fire Department. We had grown up together in working-class Queens, New York. They were supposed to be off-duty that day. But then the call came in. Both brothers responded. Only one came home. On Sept. 12th, I stood at what had been the World Trade Center. All that remained was ash and smoke. My cousin, Battalion Chief John Moran, was listed amongst the missing, but deep down I knew he wasn't coming home. Neither were the other 342 missing firefighters. The weight of his loss felt heavy. But there by my side was Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, the New York senator. Hillary Clinton, my friend.She understood the pain my family, our city, our nation were under. She fought to help our city rebuild and she delivered. People forget, but the assistance package that was first proposed didn't have a dime -- not a dime -- for New York. Hillary helped turn that around, securing $20 billion we needed to get New York going again. But she didn't stop there. Hundreds worked on the pile in the days after 9/11. They came first to find survivors but eventually searched for remains. They didn't worry about their own health. They were told the air was fine. But it wasn't. And when health issues emerged years later, Hillary Clinton was still by their side. She brought families and first responders to Washington. She took them door to door, never letting her colleagues forget the consequences of that terrible day. For almost a decade, Hillary never gave up, and she was there with us when the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act was finally passed. But let me ask you something. Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and the years after 9/11? He didn't stand at the Pile. He didn't lobby Congress for help. He didn't fight for the first responders. Nope. He cashed in -- collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected. Hillary sought these funds to help local mom and pop shops get back on their feet. Donald Trump sought another payday for his empire. It was one of our nation's darkest days, but to Trump it was just another chance to make a quick buck. Hillary has never and will never forget the reality of that day. And that's why she will never give up on making us a better and stronger nation. My cousin, John, carried with him a quote from Teddy Roosevelt. It reads in part, ''It's not the critic who counts, not the men who points out how the strong men stumbled or where they do or deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena, whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood who tries valiantly.'' My friends, this is the Hillary Clinton I know. The doer of deeds who have stood and work and fought alongside. This is the Hillary Clinton I believe in -- the proven fighter who has been devoted and has devoted herself to helping American families, American workers, and cops and firefighters and first responders. Helping all Americans. And this is the Hillary Clinton I support -- the woman who has been in the arena, who knows what it will take to keep America safe and defeat and destroy ISIS, and has demonstrated the leadership and determination we need in our next president. My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, I'm with her. I'm with Hillary because Hillary has always -- always -- been with us!",2,,,
Lauren Maning,"My name is Lauren Manning and when I arrived at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, I was a partner at Cantor Fitzgerald. I was a wife and a mother. A moment later, I found myself in the midst of the worst peacetime attack in this nation's history. I was catastrophically burned over 82 percent of my body. My chances of survival next to zero. I battled for months to live and for years to recover. I fought in tribute to my friends and colleagues at Cantor Fitzgerald that I lost that day and all the 2,996 people who were killed. I fought to honor our troops who were fighting and continue to fight on the front lines for each and every one of us around the world. And I fought to return to my young son, 10 months old at the time. I fought as hard as I could so that the terrorists would not get one more. Hillary Clinton stood with me through that fight. And in the darkest of days and in the hardest of times, the people who show up in your life are the ones that mean everything. Hillary showed up. She walked into my hospital room and she took my bandaged hand into her own. Our connection wasn't between a senator and a constituent; it was person to person. And as a woman working in business for years, I know you have to be tough and in that woman is a hell of a tough person. For years she visited, called, and continues to check in because Hillary cares. When I needed her, she was there. When our first responders needed her, she was there. When New York needed her, she was there. I trusted her when my life was on the line and she came through, not for the cameras, not because anyone was watching but because that's who she is -- kind, caring, loyal. She had my back. This is the Hillary Clinton I want you to know. She was there for me and that's why I'm with her. Thank you.",2,,,
Madeline Albright,"Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much! My fellow Americans, good evening. Sixty eight years ago, during a time of grave danger, Democrats gathered in Philadelphia to nominate a tough, smart, and experienced presidential candidate. At the time, I was a child in Europe where I lived in fear because my native Czechoslovakia had been taken over by communists. But within a few months, my family found refuge in America and that candidate, Harry Truman, became my first American President. Tonight, in Philadelphia, we nominated someone with Truman's fighting spirit to be our next president, Hillary Clinton. And this fall, we must do everything we can to make sure that Hillary becomes our next commander-in-chief, because in this era, with these threats, we need a leader who has the experience and judgment to keep America strong, secure, and safe. I know Hillary Clinton will be that president because I have known her for more than 25 years, because I have seen her fight and win for our country and for causes that count. When Hillary was First Lady we went to the Beijing Women's Conference and she courageously stood up and spoke out on behalf of human rights and women's rights, inspiring millions to fight for a better future. We went to Prague where I showed her the city of my birth and made her eat Czech cabbage. She didn't like it very much. We met with Vaclav Havel, who she did like very much because he made so many dreams of freedom come true. When Hillary served in the Senate, I saw her work day and night as a member of the Armed Services Committee working with Republicans and Democrats to keep our military strong and protect our troops and their families. And when Hillary served as Secretary of State, I watched her partner with President Obama to restore our country's reputation around the world. She fought terrorism. She stopped the spread of nuclear weapons. And she promoted diplomacy, defense, development, and democracy -- smart power -- in every corner of the world.As I travel around the world today, I'm reminded how important it is that the person who represents our nation is trusted by our allies and who listens more than she talks. Hillary and I share a few things in common. We both went to Wellesley College, so I know where she got her study habits. We are both mothers and grandmothers, so I know where she got her management skills. We are both very proud of our daughters and grandsons, so we must've done something right. But we also know what it's like to step off that plane with the words United States of America on it. She knows that safeguarding freedom and security is not like hosting a TV reality show. It is a complex, round the clock job that demands not only a steady hand and a cool head but also a big heart. You are not just representing yourself. You are there for all of us. Hillary has displayed these qualities in every job she has ever had. And last week in Cleveland, we were reminded that her opponent possesses none of them. Many have argued that Donald Trump would harm our national security if he were elected president. The fact is that he has already done damage just by running for president. He has undermined our fight against ISIS by alienating our Muslim partners. He has weakened our standing in the world by threatening to walk away from our friends and our allies and by encouraging more countries to get nuclear weapons. Donald Trump also has a strange admiration for dictators -- Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin. When asked about Putin, Donald Trump said -- and I quote -- ''in terms of leadership, he's getting an A.' The truth is that a Trump victory in November would be a gift to Vladimir Putin, and given what we have learned about Russia's recent actions, Putin is eager to see Trump to win. And that should worry every American. Take it from someone who fled the Iron Curtain, I know what happens when you give the Russians a green light. Trump's dark vision of America -- one that's isolated in the world, alienated from our allies -- would be a disaster. We must make sure that never happens. We must elect Hillary Clinton as our next president. My fellow Americans, at the age of 11, I sailed past the Statue of Liberty and started my life in the world's greatest democracy. I am so grateful to our country, and I am supporting Hillary Clinton because I love it. God bless America and God bless the American people!",2,,,

Terry McAuliffe,"Hello, Democrats! Thank you! Thank you!This is an extraordinary day. This is a day that will change the political history of our country. It's the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. And it's a day that I guarantee you will remember forever because you'll be able to say, I was there when we nominated Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States of America! And more importantly, when we made history, when we selected -- and I am so proud to announce it for the first time -- the first woman nominee in American history to lead our party to the White House. When we selected a nominee who has fought her whole life for greater justice, equality, and opportunity for every American. When we selected a nominee who doesn't just talk about making America stronger around the world, she's the only candidate with a specific plan to work with our allies and to fight ISIS all over the globe. My friends, Hillary Clinton is a nominee who is ready to stand up to the hatred and the fear-mongering and send Donald Trump back to his bankrupt casinos where he belongs! Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't praise Hillary for her excellent judgment in selecting my friend and fellow Virginian, Tim Kaine, to be the next vice president of the United States! And you can support that effort right now by going to HillaryClinton.com. Now, folks, I've known Hillary and her husband, Bill, for more than half of my life. I love this woman. I still remember her playing mermaid in the pool with our youngest daughter, Sally, for hours on family vacations. I was proud that she was the first to call and congratulate our oldest son, Jack, when he began his career as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. And I'll never forget when she and then-President Clinton did not hesitate to travel through a blizzard to attend my father's funeral. That is something you will never forget. That is friendship.Hillary is tough. She is determined. She is an amazing mother, grandmother, and wife. And I know that she loves this country more than anything else. Compare that to what we just heard from Donald Trump and the Republicans. They spent four days tearing down our country. They blamed immigrants. They blamed refugees. They blamed affordable health care and offered no solutions other than giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein. If Donald Trump really cared about American greatness, he wouldn't attack Democrats; he would follow our lead. In Virginia, we're putting our values into action to create jobs and bring our unemployment rate down from 5.3 percent when I took office to 3.7 percent today, the steepest decline a governor has seen at this point in his term in 32 years in Virginia. We have made record investments in public education, expanded access so we have a healthy nutritious plan for all of our children.And let me tell you this folks, I am so proud of Virginia. We were the first state in the United States of America to be certified to functionally have ended veteran homelessness in our state. We have fought Republican efforts to discriminate against LGBT Virginians, and we have stood up for a woman's right to choose. And we are overcoming obstacles to deny hundreds of thousands of former felons their right to vote because history tells us that enemies of progress can slow the march towards justice and equality, but they cannot stop us. We have come so far since 2008, but there is more work to be done. That's why I support Hillary Clinton, because I want a president who will build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. A president who tackles global warming head on and stands up for common sense solutions to keep guns away from dangerous people. A president who has vision, purpose, and the experience to lead our nation -- not cheesy slogans and silly hats. A president who will build our country up and not tear it down to scare up votes. My friends, I have known Hillary for decades. I have seen her in action. I know that she the kind of leader she will be and she will lead this nation. Tonight we made history, but the fight has just begun. It is time for us to get to work and to make my friend, Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States of America.Thank you!",2,,,
Tom Harkin,"Twenty-six years ago today our nation won a hard-fought battle to end discrimination for over 50 million people when we signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA. Today I am proud to say that the ADA has helped so many share in America's promise. We are better prepared to give all of our children access to quality education, help our wounded warriors when they come home, and support our aging population. We got this done because they disability community understood and knew what Hillary Clinton knows -- we are stronger together. We brought together Republicans and Democrats, businesses and advocates. We stood up to fear and irrational prejudices. We are a better nation because of the ADA. But we still have a way to go before we build a truly inclusive America. When 26 years later, 70 percent of adults with disabilities in America aren't in the workforce, it's time to take action. And that's why, that's why Hillary Clinton wants to ensure that people with disabilities are judged by their potential and have the tools to secure competitive integrated employment. When 26 years later, employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage, it is time to change that law. Hillary Clinton will fight to eliminate the sub-minimum wage to ensure that a fair day's work earns a fair day's pay. When 26 years later Medicaid still keeps people with disabilities in nursing homes, it's time to pass Senator Chuck Schumer's Disability Integration Act so that our fellow American's can live where they want -- a bill that Hillary Clinton will sign into law as president of the United States. Only one person seeking the presidency understands the disability community's phrase, ''Nothing about us without us.'' As president, Hillary Clinton will bring people with disabilities to the table for a more inclusive America. Now I learned sign language from my brother, Frank, when I was growing up. And now I want to teach all of you a beautiful sign, which connects with the values of this campaign. Are you ready? I am going to teach you this sign.

Over here, up there, put your hands together just like this, and move it in a circle in front of your body. That, my friends, is the sign for America. It's a beautiful sign. Think about it. We are all together. We are all together.

Barack Obama,"Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I love you back! Hello, America! Hello, Democrats! So 12 years ago tonight, I addressed this convention for the very first time. You met my two little girls, Malia and Sasha -- now two amazing young women who just fill me with pride. You fell for my brilliant wife and partner, Michelle -- who has made me a better father and a better man; who's gone on to inspire our nation as First Lady -- and who somehow hasn't aged a day. I know, the same can't be said for me. My girls remind me all the time. Wow, you've changed so much, Daddy And then they try to clean it up -- not bad, you're just more mature. And it's true -- I was so young that first time in Boston. And look, I'll admit it, maybe I was a little nervous, addressing such a big crowd. But I was filled with faith; faith in America -- the generous, big-hearted, hopeful country that made my story -- that made all of our stories -- possible.A lot has happened over the years. And while this nation has been tested by war, and it's been tested by recession and all manner of challenges -- I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your president, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before. How could I not be -- after all that we've achieved together? After the worst recession in 80 years, we fought our way back. We've seen deficits come down, 401(k)s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach eight-year lows, and our businesses create 15 million new jobs. After a century of trying, we declared that healthcare in America is not a privilege for a few, it is a right for everybody. After decades of talk, we finally began to wean ourselves off foreign oil. We doubled our production of clean energy. We brought more of our troops home to their families, and we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program. We opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our children. We put policies in place to help students with loans; protect consumers from fraud; cut veteran homelessness almost in half. And through countless acts of quiet courage, America learned that love has no limits, and marriage equality is now a reality across the land. By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started. And through every victory and every setback, I've insisted that change is never easy, and never quick; that we wouldn't meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime. So, tonight, I'm here to tell you that, yes, we've still got more work to do. More work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who has not yet felt the progress of these past seven and a half years. We need to keep making our streets safer and our criminal justice system fairer -- our homeland more secure, our world more peaceful and sustainable for the next generation. We're not done perfecting our union, or living up to our founding creed that all of us are created equal; all of us are free in the eyes of God. And that work involves a big choice this November. I think it's fair to say, this is not your typical election. It's not just a choice between parties or policies; the usual debates between left and right. This is a more fundamental choice -- about who we are as a people, and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government.Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's precisely this contest of idea that pushes our country forward. But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn't conservative. What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems -- just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.And that is not the America I know. The America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous. Sure, we have real anxieties -- about paying the bills, and protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent. We get frustrated with political gridlock, and worry about racial divisions. We are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando or Nice. There are pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures; men who took pride in hard work and providing for their families who now feel forgotten; parents who wonder whether their kids will have the same opportunities that we had. All of that is real. We are challenged to do better; to be better. But as I've traveled this country, through all 50 states, as I've rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I have also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America. I see people working hard and starting businesses. I see people teaching kids and serving our country. I see engineers inventing stuff, doctors coming up with new cures. I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, not constrained by what is, ready to seize what ought to be. And most of all, I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together -- black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love. That's what I see. That's the America I know! And there is only one candidate in this race who believes in that future, has devoted her life to that future; a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive; a leader with real plans to break down barriers, and blast through glass ceilings, and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American -- the next president of the United States, Hillary Clinton. That's right! Let me tell you, eight years ago, you may remember Hillary and I were rivals for the Democratic nomination. We battled for a year and a half. Let me tell you, it was tough, because Hillary was tough. I was worn out. She was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels. And every time I thought I might have the race won, Hillary just came back stronger. But after it was all over, I asked Hillary to join my team. And she was a little surprised. Some of my staff was surprised. But ultimately she said yes -- because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us. And for four years -- for four years, I had a front-row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline. I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasn't for praise, it wasn't for attention -- that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion. I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who she's fighting for. Hillary has still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education. She's still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a Children's Health Insurance Program that to this day protects millions of kids. She's still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11 -- which is why, as a senator from New York, she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild; why, as secretary of State, she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out Bin Laden. You know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office. You can read about it. You can study it. But until you've sat at that desk, you don't know what it's like to manage a global crisis, or send young people to war. But Hillary has been in the room; she's been part of those decisions. She knows what's at stake in the decisions our government makes -- what's at stake for the working family, for the senior citizen, or the small business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran. And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits. That is the Hillary I know. That's the Hillary I've come to admire. And that's why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not Bill, nobody -- more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America. I hope you don't mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man. And, by the way, in case you're wondering about her judgment, take a look at her choice of running mate. Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know. I know his family. I love Anne. I love their kids. He will be a great vice president. He will make Hillary a better president -- just like my dear friend and brother, Joe Biden, has made me a better president. Now, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns she's heard from you on the campaign trail. She's got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their company's profits, to help put kids in preschool and put students through college without taking on a ton of debt. That's what leaders do. And then there's Donald Trump. Don't boo -- vote. You know, the Donald is not really a plans guy. He's not really a facts guy, either. He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who've achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated. Does anyone really believe that a guy who's spent his 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion? Your voice?If so, you should vote for him. But if you're someone who's truly concerned about paying your bills, if you're really concerned about pocketbook issues and seeing the economy grow, and creating more opportunity for everybody, then the choice isn't even close. If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages, and better benefits, and a fairer tax code, and a bigger voice for workers, and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton. If you're rightly concerned about who's going to keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world, well, the choice is even clearer. Hillary Clinton is respected around the world -- not just by leaders, but by the people they serve.I have to say this. People outside of the United States do not understand what's going on in this election. They really don't. Because they know Hillary. They've seen her work. She's worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military. She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism. It's not new to her. Our troops have pounded ISIL without mercy, taking out their leaders, taking back territory. And I know Hillary won't relent until ISIL is destroyed. She will finish the job. And she will do it without resorting to torture, or banning entire religions from entering our country. She is fit and she is ready to be the next commander-in-chief. Meanwhile, Donald Trump calls our military a disaster. Apparently, he doesn't know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. He suggests America is weak. He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights. He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection.Well, America's promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments. We bear our burdens. That's one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office. America is already great. America is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump. In fact, it doesn't depend on any one person. And that, in the end, may be the biggest difference in this election -- the meaning of our democracy. Ronald Reagan called America Òa shining city on a hill.Ó Donald Trump calls it Òa divided crime sceneÓ that only he can fix. It doesn't matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they've been in decades -- because he's not actually offering any real solutions to those issues. He's just offering slogans, and he's offering fear. He's betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election. And that's another bet that Donald Trump will lose. And the reason he'll lose it is because he's selling the American people short. We're not a fragile people. We're not a frightful people. Our power doesn't come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don't look to be ruled. Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union. That's who we are. That's our birthright -- the capacity to shape our own destiny. That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent. It's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma, and workers to organize and fight for collective bargaining and better wages. America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. It's about what can be achieved by us, together -- through the hard and slow, and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government.And that's what Hillary Clinton understands. She knows that this is a big, diverse country. She has seen it. She's traveled. She's talked to folks. And she understands that most issues are rarely black and white. She understands that even when you're 100 percent right, getting things done requires compromise; that democracy doesn't work if we constantly demonize each other. She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other, and see ourselves in each other, and fight for our principles but also fight to find common ground, no matter how elusive that may sometimes seem. Hillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry black parents feel when their son leaves the house isn't so different than what a brave cop's family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work; that we can honor police and treat every community fairly. We can do that. And she knows -- she knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn't making race relations worse -- it's creating the possibility for people of goodwill to join and make things better. Hillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists; families that came here for the same reason our forebears came -- to work and to study, and to make a better life, in a place where we can talk and worship and love as we please. She knows their dream is quintessentially American, and the American Dream is something no wall will ever contain. These are the things that Hillary knows.It can be frustrating, this business of democracy. Trust me, I know. Hillary knows, too. When the other side refuses to compromise, progress can stall. People are hurt by the inaction. Supporters can grow impatient and worry that you're not trying hard enough; that you've maybe sold out. But I promise you, when we keep at it, when we change enough minds, when we deliver enough votes, then progress does happen. And if you doubt that, just ask the 20 million more people who have healthcare today. Just ask the Marine who proudly serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves. Democracy works, America, but we got to want it -- not just during an election year, but all the days in between. So if you agree that there's too much inequality in our economy and too much money in our politics, we all need to be as vocal and as organized and as persistent as Bernie Sanders supporters have been during this election. We all need to get out and vote for Democrats up and down the ticket, and then hold them accountable until they get the job done. That's right -- feel the Bern! If you want more justice in the justice system, then we've all got to vote -- not just for a president, but for mayors, and sheriffs, and state's attorneys, and state legislators. That's where the criminal law is made. And we've got to work with police and protesters until laws and practices are changed. That's how democracy works. If you want to fight climate change, we've got to engage not only young people on college campuses, we've got to reach out to the coal miner who's worried about taking care of his family, the single mom worried about gas prices. If you want to protect our kids and our cops from gun violence, we've got to get the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, who agree on things like background checks to be just as vocal and just as determined as the gun lobby that blocks change through every funeral that we hold. That is how change happens. Look, Hillary has got her share of critics. She has been caricatured by the right and by some on the left. She has been accused of everything you can imagine -- and some things that you cannot. But she knows that's what happens when you're under a microscope for 40 years. She knows that sometimes during those 40 years she's made mistakes -- just like I have; just like we all do. That's what happens when we try. That's what happens when you're the kind of citizen Teddy Roosevelt once described -- not the timid souls who criticize from the sidelines, but someone Òwho is actually in the arena, who strives valiantly; who errs, but who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.Ó Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena. She's been there for us -- even if we haven't always noticed. And if you're serious about our democracy, you can't afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue. You've got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn't a spectator sport. America isn't about Òyes, he will.Ó It's about Òyes, we can.Ó And we're going to carry Hillary to victory this fall, because that's what the moment demands. Yes, we can. Not ''yes, she can.'' Not ''yes, I can.'' ''Yes, we can.''  You know, there's been a lot of talk in this campaign about what America has lost -- people who tell us that our way of life is being undermined by pernicious changes and dark forces beyond our control. They tell voters there's a Òreal AmericaÓ out there that must be restored. This isn't an idea, by the way, that started with Donald Trump. It's been peddled by politicians for a long time -- probably from the start of our Republic.And it's got me thinking about the story I told you 12 years ago tonight, about my Kansas grandparents and the things they taught me when I was growing up. See, my grandparents, they came from the heartland. Their ancestors began settling there about 200 years ago. I don't know if they have their birth certificates -- (laughter) -- but they were there. They were Scotch-Irish mostly -- farmers, teachers, ranch hands, pharmacists, oil rig workers. Hardy, small town folks. Some were Democrats, but a lot of them -- maybe even most of them -- were Republicans. Party of Lincoln. And my grandparents explained that folks in these parts, they didn't like show-offs. They didn't admire braggarts or bullies. They didn't respect mean-spiritedness, or folks who were always looking for shortcuts in life. Instead, what they valued were traits like honesty and hard work, kindness, courtesy, humility, responsibility, helping each other out. That's what they believed in. True things. Things that last. The things we try to teach our kids.And what my grandparents understood was that these values weren't limited to Kansas. They weren't limited to small towns. These values could travel to Hawaii. They could travel even to the other side of the world, where my mother would end up working to help poor women get a better life; trying to apply those values. My grandparents knew these values weren't reserved for one race. They could be passed down to a half-Kenyan grandson, or a half-Asian granddaughter. In fact, they were the same values Michelle's parents, the descendants of slaves, taught their own kids, living in a bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. They knew these values were exactly what drew immigrants here, and they believed that the children of those immigrants were just as American as their own, whether they wore a cowboy hat or a yarmulke, a baseball cap or a hijab. America has changed over the years. But these values that my grandparents taught me -- they haven't gone anywhere. They're as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith. They live on in each of us. What makes us American, what makes us patriots is what's in here. That's what matters. And that's why we can take the food and music and holidays and styles of other countries, and blend it into something uniquely our own. That's why we can attract strivers and entrepreneurs from around the globe to build new factories and create new industries here. That's why our military can look the way it does -- every shade of humanity, forged into common service. That's why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end. That is America. That is America. Those bonds of affection; that common creed. We don't fear the future; we shape it. We embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own. That's what Hillary Clinton understands -- this fighter, this stateswoman, this mother and grandmother, this public servant, this patriot -- that's the America she's fighting for. And that is why I have confidence, as I leave this stage tonight, that the Democratic Party is in good hands. My time in this office, it hasn't fixed everything. As much as we've done, there's still so much I want to do. But for all the tough lessons I've had to learn, for all the places where I've fallen short -- I've told Hillary, and I'll tell you, what's picked me back up every single time: It's been you. The American people. It's the letter I keep on my wall from a survivor in Ohio who twice almost lost everything to cancer, but urged me to keep fighting for health care reform, even when the battle seemed lost. Do not quit.It's the painting I keep in my private office, a big-eyed, green owl with blue wings, made by a seven year-old girl who was taken from us in Newtown, given to me by her parents so I wouldn't forget -- a reminder of all the parents who have turned their grief into action. It's the small business owner in Colorado who cut most of his own salary so he wouldn't have to lay off any of his workers in the recession -- because, he said, Òthat wouldn't have been in the spirit of America.ÓIt's the conservative in Texas who said he disagreed with me on everything, but he appreciated that, like him, I try to be a good dad. It's the courage of the young soldier from Arizona who nearly died on the battlefield in Afghanistan, but who has learned to speak again and walk again -- and earlier this year, stepped through the door of the Oval Office on his own power, to salute and shake my hand. It is every American who believed we could change this country for the better, so many of you who'd never been involved in politics, who picked up phones and hit the streets, and used the Internet in amazing new ways that I didn't really understand, but made change happen. You are the best organizers on the planet, and I am so proud of all the change that you made possible. Time and again, you've picked me up. And I hope, sometimes, I picked you up, too. And tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me. I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. Because you're who I was talking about 12 years ago when I talked about hope. It's been you who fueled my dogged faith in our future, even when the odds were great; even when the road is long. Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope. America, you've vindicated that hope these past eight years. And now I'm ready to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen. So this year, in this election, I'm asking you to join me -- to reject cynicism and reject fear, and to summon what is best in us; to elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States, and show the world we still believe in the promise of this great nation. Thank you for this incredible journey. Let's keep it going. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. ",3,,,
Chris Murphy,"Thank you. There are days when I wish I hadn't been there. There are moments when I try to forget the things that I saw, the things that I heard that soul-crushing morning at the firehouse in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. The grief, the unending, mind-altering, paralyzing sorrow that comes with losing a child to gun violence. It is unimaginable. And, only those who live it, know it. In Newtown, Connecticut, families of 20 first-graders and their six teachers, they live with it every minute of every day. And across the country each day, unbelievably, 90 families join them. My oldest son is the same age as those kids in Sandy Hook. He just finished first grade.<br />My wife and I are the same age of those parents. And, I am furious. I am furious that in three years since Sandy Hook, three years of almost daily bloodshed in our cities, the Republican Congress has done absolutely nothing to prevent the next massacre. It stokes inside me a sense of outrage that I've never felt before. And, that's what drove me to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for 15 hours to demand change. And, I'm here today because I want a president who shares that same sense of outrage. Outrage that the gun lobby fights to keep open glaring loopholes that 90% of Americans want closed. Outrage that a suspected terrorist can walk inside a gun store and walk out with a military-style semi-automatic weapon. Now, Hillary Clinton -- she didn't have to make fighting gun violence a centerpiece of her campaign. Frankly, I'm sure people told her that it wasn't worth the political risk. But, she held firm. She stood up to the NRA, and Hillary Clinton pledged to take Washington back from the gun lobby. And Donald Trump, when he sees gun violence devastating our communities, it's just like everything else. He sees it an opportunity. Another opportunity to convince Americans that they should fear another. Another opportunity to do the bidding of the gun lobby. Listen, 90% of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands. But Trump says that in his first hour in the Oval Office, he'll roll back safeguards that we already have. And even more sinister, Trump said that by the end of this first day in office, he'll mandate that every school in America allow guns in their classrooms. Think about that for a moment. Of all of the things that Donald Trump could have promised to do on his first day in office, he chose weakening background checks and putting guns in elementary schools. This is a fate that we cannot accept. And so, my friends, there is no reason to feel helpless about the glorifying trajectory of cascading massacres. Because you know what? We can change this. Smart gun policy like background checks -- it can make this country safer. Now, I stood on the floor of the United States Senate for 15 hours because I had had enough. Enough of children dying in our classrooms. Enough of the nightly bloodshed on our city streets. Enough of police officers being outgunned, ambushed, and cut down in the line of duty. I've had it -- enough! And friends, it is time to take Washington back from the gun lobby. And, I know just how to do it. I want you to start -- I want you to start by texting the word LAWS to 47246. You're going to learn there about the dangerous loopholes in our gun laws. You're going to turn yourself into an activist. And then you are going to go and elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States because she is a leader who has the empathy and the guts to declare with every fiber in her being that we have had enough! Thank you.",3,,,
Christine Leinonen,"It takes about 5 minutes for a church bell to ring 49 times. I know this because last month, my son Christopher, his boyfriend Juan, and 47 others were murdered at a club in Orlando. Christopher was my only child. As I used to tell him, ''You can't do better than perfect.'' He had so many friends -- two of whom are here tonight representing hundreds and hundreds more. All his life, he brought people together. In high school, he won the Anne Frank Humanitarian Award for starting a gay-straight alliance. Christopher's paternal grandparents met and fell in love in a Japanese internment camp, so it was in his DNA that love always trumps hate. Christopher -- Christopher was a big Hillary supporter. That's why I'm here. So that I can tell you about the day that he was born. At the time, I was a Michigan state trooper. When I went into labor, the hospital put my off-duty gun in a safe. I didn't argue; I know common sense gun policies save lives. The weapon that murdered my son fires 30 rounds in one minute. An Orlando city commissioner pointed out the terrible math -- one minute for a gun to fire so many shots, five minutes for a bell to honor so many lives. I'm glad common sense gun policy was in place the day Christopher was born. But where was that common sense the day he died? I never want you to ask that question about your child. That's why I support Hillary Clinton.",3,,,
Erica Smegielski,"I should not be here tonight. I don't want to be here tonight. I should be home like so many Americans watching on TV with my mother as we nominate the first woman to be president of the United States. But my mom was murdered. So I'm here. I'm here for the mothers and daughters who are planning weddings so that you get to watch your daughters walk down the aisle. I'm here for those lives cut short in a school, in a movie theater, in a church, at work, in their neighborhoods, or homes because those voices should never be silenced. I'm here alone without my mother while too many politicians cower behind the gun lobby instead of standing with American families. We don't need another Charleston or San Bernardino or Dallas or countless other acts of everyday gun violence that don't make the headlines. We don't need our teachers and principals going to work in fear. What we need is another mother who's willing to do what's right, whose bravery can live up in equal measure to my mom's. What we need is to elect Hillary Clinton as the 45th president of the United States of America, so that no other daughter ever has to say, ''I would give every single day that I have left for just one more day with my mom.",3,,,
Felicia Sanders Polly Sheppard,"Good evening. My son's last words were, 'We mean you no harm.' Tywanza. My hero. Two days later, I forgave the shooter who murdered him. Hate destroys those who harbor it. I refused to let hate destroy me. Though I have to ask: How was he able to purchase a gun he used to kill so many? After that fateful day, Hillary Clinton called on lawmakers to close the Charleston loophole. Because of the loophole, even though the shooter had an arrest record, when it didn't surface and three days passed, he could still buy that gun. No one should feel what I've seen. No one should feel how we feel, how we've suffered. The Bible tells us that if we humble ourselves, pray, and turn from our wicked ways, God will forgive us and heal our land. Let us heed God's word and in turn may God heal our nation. Amen. To heal, we must forgive. That's what I've learned this past year. The shooter in Charleston had hate in his heart. The shooter in Orlando had hate in his heart. And the shooter in Dallas did too. So much hate, too much. But as scripture says love never fails. So I choose love. And in this election, I choose Hillary Clinton. Hillary was in South Carolina the day before the shooting, and in the days that followed, she talked about the hatred in our nation, the racism, the injustice. She said that we can't hide from these truths. She called on us to name them and own them and then change them. Together we can fight for that change. Together we can heal. Together we can love. Thank you.",3,,,
Gabby Gifford,"Hello, fellow Democrats! What a crowd! I'm honored to be here today. We have important work ahead of us -- work that will determine the future of our country. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? I'm ready. In Congress, I learned a powerful lesson -- strong women get things done. Hillary is tough. Hillary is courageous. She will fight to make our families safer. In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby. That's why I'm voting for Hillary. Speaking is difficult for me. But come January, I want to say these two words: ''Madam President''! Thank you very much!",3,,,
Gavin Newsom,"I'm Gavin Newsom and I'm a proud Democrat from the great state of California. I'm proud because today's California is strong and getting stronger. It's a jet-propelled engine of job creation, home court for creativity around the word, and we've done it, not just through innovation, but we've done it by inclusion. We're pro-immigrant, pro-environment, pro-women, pro-worker and proudly pro gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender. We aren't the Golden State despite our values; we're the Golden State because of them. At our best, we don't tolerate our diversity. At our best we celebrate it. Those values of liberty, diversity, and opportunity -- those are fundamentally American values. And those values are under attack not just by enemies abroad, but by a GOP that has moved its fear-mongering fringe to center stage. What Donald Trump presented last week, it wasn't political discourse; it wasn't even political incorrectness. What Trump presented last week was defeatist and retreatist. Never has a speech been so long with so little substance, so little science, so little humanity, humor, or so little hope. His hostile takeover of the American dream is built on two fundamental lies -- that America is a dark and desperate place and that he has a kind of plan to make it better. Trump strangled the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan and replaced ''tear down that wall ''with a cynical bigotry of build that wall. Contempt for the Constitution, inhumane mass deportation, malice towards different views and different hues -- those are disqualifications from any office, let alone the highest office in the land. And Democrats, while it was refreshing to finally see an openly gay man speak at a Republican convention, it doesn't remove the stain of selecting Mike Pence, America's most anti-LGBT governor. Pence has supported overt discrimination. He's even advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy. Now, make no mistake, conversion therapy is not about praying away the gay. It's an emotional torture against our most innocent citizens -- our children. Telling them that to live, they must lie -- lie about who they are and lie about who they love. That is fundamentally un-American. So, the age old choice, it's never been more clear, we can live our fears or we can live our dreams. Hillary Clinton has dedicated her entire life to putting the American dream within reach. She believes in diversity over division, the hard work of pluralism over the illusion of differences. And as a father of four, I want to say this. I want to say something to all the children who are watching, all the children that are listening at home. When you hear people say that you and your family don't matter because of who you are or where you come from or what you look like or who you love, I want you to know one thing -- that the people in this room, the people all across this country, believe that you matter. Hillary Clinton believes that you matter. We believe that you belong here. We need you here. We believe that you can be whoever you are and become whatever you want to be. And we're going to fight for you. We're going to fight for you not just over the next hundred days, but over the next hundred years because no matter what people tell you, that's what America is all about. That's what makes America great!Thank you all!",3,,,
GK Butterfield,"I'm Congressman GK Butterfield from North Carolina. In my community, you judge a man's heart by his words and deeds. Donald J Trump, your words have been hostile. They have been bigoted and insulting. You have used every opportunity to talk about your wealth, to denigrate people who don't hold your views even within your own party. You are not qualified to serve as president of the United States. Instead of putting forth details to address income inequality and opportunity for everyday Americans, you use your celebrity status to paint a picture of gloom and doom. You use your status to alienate African-American and other groups, and you would use the office of President to take our great nation in the wrong direction. You want to know why your polling numbers are so dismal among African-Americans? I will tell you. We know -- we know you have gotten rich through your business but we also know your wealth has come at the expense of other people. We know, we know, we know you have no plan to address issues directly affecting African-American communities, such as gun violence and voting rights, historically black colleges and universities, raising the minimum wage and addressing persistent poverty. Democrats want a better future for all of our people, for all of our families. Read our platform and compare it to the Republican platform. Give us this chance. Give us this chance by electing Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine to lead our great country!",3,,,
Hakeem Jeffries,"I'm Hakeem Jeffries from the great state of New York! We are here today, standing on the shoulders of giants. Like Shirley Chisholm, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Barbara Jordan, Charlie Rangel, and so many others who made it possible for a kid like me to serve in the United States Congress. In November the American People face a clear choice between the most qualified person ever to seek the presidency and the least qualified person ever to seek the presidency. It's a choice between a commander in chief and a bankrupter in chief. It's a choice between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Hate. Donald Trump is a bounced check, but Hillary Clinton is money in the bank. She believes that America is a better place today because of the presidency of Barack Obama. She believes we should provide for the poor, work for working families, make sense for the middle class, and stand up for senior citizens. She believes we should innovate in the inner cities, strengthen suburban communities, and revitalize rural America. She believes we should increase economic opportunity, end the era or mass incarceration, and eradicate police brutality once and for all. And she believes that whether you're black or white, Latino or Asian, Jewish or Muslim, Catholic or Protestant, gay or straight, young or old that in this great country, every single American deserves equal protection under the law. And that's why together we're going to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton as the next president of the United States of America. God bless you.",3,,,
Harry Reid,"I've spent a lot of time in the Republican Senate, so it's nice to be in a room that respects reason and facts. I appreciate the tribute. I really do. I appreciate the tribute. But anything I've accomplished in Senate I owe to the great teammates I've had -- my Democratic Senate caucus, Nancy Pelosi in the House, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and I give a never-ending tribute to our next president, Hilary Clinton. As a team, we fought for the belief that affordable health care is a right, not a privilege. As a team, we fought for the idea that you shouldn't get the bill for Wall Street's bad bets. As a team, we fought for the promise that your hard earned Social Security is a sacred trust. Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to put insurance companies back in charge of your health. Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to let big banks run wild again. And Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market. Republicans want to tear down the pillars of middle class security. We won't let that happen. And I have never seen anything more craven then Mitch McConnell and what he's done to our democracy. His Republican Party decided that the answer to our great American dream is to slander our African-American president, stoke fear of Muslims, sow hatred of Latinos and insult Asians and, of course, wage war against women. In other words, the only thing Republicans like Mitch McConnell have accomplished is setting the stage for a hateful con-man Ð Donald Trump. When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself, ''I'm an ego maniac. I don't believe in science, I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?'' We know where that is. Parents, you're right to worry about your children hearing what comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. Republicans, you should have been careful also because Donald Trump learned it from watching you. You know they say, they believe in country first Ð what a joke! Republicans that won't stand up to Trump believe in one thing and one thing only -- party first. And this year, 2016, they've gone even further nominating the poster child of ''me first''.Trump knew that hateful rhetoric and dangerous policies are the way to win in today's GOP. But that's not how you win in America and that's not how America wins in the world. Democrats know we win with an economy that works for everybody, with a strong, smart nation security that values our allies and doesn't invite a cyber-attack on our country. And we know winning is the work of a team. With Hilary in the White House and a majority in the Senate, Democrats will keep fighting for immigration reform that keeps America true, clean energy that keeps America strong, and a Supreme Court that keeps America just, and background checks for gun buyers and an assault weapons ban that keeps America safe.Since my boxing days, I've fought my share of fights. In my 50 years of fighting for Nevadans, I've also realized a leader is actually a corner man -- a corner man -- someone who stands on your side, who has your back in a fight. Middle-class families fighting to give your kids a better life, Democrats stand in your corner. Americans fighting for the equality and respect our nation promises you, we're in your corner. New Americans risking everything to get here and then fighting to make it here, we're in your corner. You're the ones fighting the hardest fights. You're the ones who need leaders in your corner. Leaders like my forever friend, Bernie Sanders. Leaders like Catherine Cortez Masto who's going to help Democrats take back the Senate. Leaders who've never back down. And oh, do we love Tim Kaine. We really do. Leaders who have had your back their whole life, like Hillary Clinton, the most qualified and prepared candidate in the history of America. In a few months, I'll be stepping out of the ring one last time. But Democrats will always -- always -- be in your corner. So together let's keep fighting -- together -- fighting the good fight. Thank you very much!",3,,,
Jamie Dorff,"Thank you. Thank you. I will never forget the moment I heard that Patrick's helicopter did not return. In an instant, the life I knew was destroyed. The partner I loved gone. My daughter's father taken away forever. I never felt more scared or alone than I did then. I wondered what Christmas and birthdays would look like. But half a country away, a United States senator was looking out for me and countless others like me. Her name was Hillary Clinton. You see, before Hillary Clinton took office, the families of fallen soldiers receive $12,000.00. And yet when you need to bury your best friend, when you need to raise a child on your own, when you need to rebuild your life from rubble, $12,000 doesn't go far. Hillary understood so she did something about it. Without fuss or fanfare, she worked across party lines. She led Congress to increase survivor benefits to $100,000 and it made all the difference in the world. Looking back on it, I didn't even realize who was responsible. And when I did learn about Hillary's work, I didn't see her as a Democrat or a Republican; I simply saw a fighter for people like us, for families like mine. She stood up for the principle that a family's personal tragedy must not be a financial tragedy as well. Today, my daughter is finishing high school. I'm completing my degree in emergency crisis management, committed to serving my country in the best way that I can. And our family is making it, step by step, day by day. Hillary Clinton has fought for families like mine each and every day of her career. This is a woman who I have never met, whose life could not be any more different than my own but who has stood with my family and me over and over again. Hillary has always been with me in bad times and in worse, and that's why I am with her.",3,,,
Jerry Brown,"As we just saw, climate change is unlike any other threat we humans face. It's overarching and affects the entire earth and all living things. It's slow, it's relentless, and it's slipping to irreversible tipping points and vast unknowns. Combatting climate change -- the existential threat of our time -- will take heroic effort on the part of many people and many nations. Make no mistake -- climate change is real. The vast majority of world leaders and climate scientists, like those at NASA and the Department of Defense -- indeed, almost anyone who chooses to think -- believes in the science of climate change and sees the moral imperative to take action. But you wouldn't know it by listening to Donald Trump. Last week at the Republican Convention for 76 long and painful minutes, Trump conjured up a host of dark threats but never once mentioned the words ''climate change'' or ''global warming''. What do you expect? Trump represents a party with officials who have banned state employees from even using those words in Florida and who else knows where else. Trump says global warming is a hoax. I say Trump is a fraud. Trump says there's no drought in California. I say Trump lies. So it's not surprising that Trump chose as his running mate a man who denies there's such a thing as evolution. Rarely in American history have two parties diverged so profoundly. Even the know-nothing, anti-immigrant party of the 1850s did not stray this far into sheer ignorance and dark fantasy as have the Republicans and their leader, Donald Trump. Our candidate Hillary Clinton couldn't be more different. While Trump talks and talks and talks, Hillary does stuff. She fights for us on the big issues. As Secretary of State, she paved the way for the historic Paris climate agreement -- an agreement which 200 nations, including China and India, enthusiastically embraced. And Mr. Trump, he says, ''The world be damned. I'm tearing it up.'' Hillary's the one who launched the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a group of nations taking action to reduce black carbon and other super climate pollutants, which cause severe heart and lung damage. And for her first day in office, President Hillary Clinton will do what's needed to combat climate change and lead the clean energy revolution. And yes, we do need a revolution, and we're gonna get one. We know something about that in California. We have solar, wind, zero emission cars, energy efficiency, and yes, a price on carbon. We're proving that even with the toughest climate laws in the country, our economy in California is growing faster than almost any nation in the whole world. Mr. Trump and those who live in climate denial say otherwise. They tell us we have to choose between saving the economy and saving the planet. Donald Trump and the climate deniers are dead wrong -- dangerously wrong. What America needs today are not deniers but leaders; not division but common purpose; not bombast but bold action. That's why we need Hillary and that's why the American people will choose her as the next president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you.",3,,,
Joe Biden,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've- Ð I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, eight years ago, I stood on a stage in Denver. And I accepted your nomination to be Vice President of the United States. And every single day since then is been the honor of our lives for Jill and me. Everyday, we've been grateful to Barack and Michelle for asking them to join us in this, join them in that incredible journey.A journey, a journey that can only happen in America.But we not only have worked together, as it becomes pretty obvious, we've become friends. We're now family.We're family. Folks, you've all seen over the last eight years, what President Obama means to this country. He's the embodiment Ð ÐHe is the embodiment of honor, resolve and character. One of the finest Presidents we have ever had.That's right.This is a man of character.And he's become a brother to Jill and me. And Michelle, I don't where you are kid, but you're incredible. You are incredible.And I was talking to Barack today, it's no longer who's going to give the best speech, we already know who did that. You were incredible Monday night.The Delaware delegation as they say in Southern Delaware Ð ÐBarack and I married way up. Way up. Folks, as I stand here tonight, I see so many friends and colleagues, like my buddy Chris Dodd and the Connecticut delegation. So many people are here. I see the faces of those who have placed their belief in Barack and me. So many faces, but one.This is kind of a bittersweet moment for Jill and me and our family. In 2008, when he was about to deploy to Iraq and again in 2012, our son Beau introduced me to the country and placed my name in nomination.You got a glimpse, I know I sound like a Dad, but you got a glimpse of what an incredibly fine young man Beau was.Thank you.Thank you.His wife Hallie, and his two kids are here tonight.But as Ernest Hemingway once wrote, the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong at the broken places. I've been made strong at the broken places, by my love Jill, by my heart, my son Hunter and the love of my life, my Ashley.And by all of you, and I mean this sincerely, those of you that have been through this, you know I mean what I say. By all of you, you're love, your prayers, your support, but you know what, we talk about, we think about the countless thousands of other people, who suffered so much more than we have, with so much less support.So much less reason to go on. But they get up, every morning, everyday. They put one foot in front of the other. They keep going. That's the unbreakable spirit of the people of America. That's who we are.That's who we are. Don't forget it. Like the people in the neighborhood that Jill and I grew up in. She in Willow Grove and mine down in Wilmington, and Claymont. The kid in Claymont with the most courage Ñ always jumped in when you were double teamed or your back was against the wall, who became a cop, because he always wanted to help people. The middle daughter of three daughters, who always made her mother smile, who was a hero to her sisters. Now a major in the United States Marine Corps because Mr. President, I wanted to serve my country.The teacher, the teachers who Jill knows, and so many of you know, who take money out of their own pockets to buy pencils and notebooks for the students who can't afford them.Why? Why, because being a teacher is not what they do, it's who they are. You know what I know, for real. These are the people who are the heart and soul of this country. It's the America that I know. The America that Hillary knows and Tim Kaine knows. You know, I've known Hillary for well over 30 years, before she was First Lady of the United States, when she became First Lady. We served in the United States Senate. And during her years of Secretary of State, once a week we had breakfast in my home, the Vice President's residence.Everybody knows, she's smart. Everybody knows, she's tough. But I know what she's passionate about. I know Hillary.Hillary understands. Hillary gets it. Hillary understands that college loan is about a lot more than getting a qualified student education. It's about saving the mom and dad from the indignity of having to look at their talented child and say sonny, honey, I'm so sorry. The bank wouldn't lend me the money. I can't help you to get to school. I know that about Hillary.Hillary understood that for years, millions of people went to bed staring at the ceiling, thinking oh my God what if I get breast cancer, or he has a heart attack. I will lose everything, what will we do then? I know about Hillary Clinton.Ladies and gentlemen, we all understand what it will mean for our daughters and granddaughters, when Hillary Clinton walks into the Oval Office as President of the United States of America. It will change their lives.My daughters and granddaughters can do anything, any son or grandson can do. And she will prove it Mr. Mayor. So let me say as clearly I can, as I can, if you live in the neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in. If you worry about your job and getting a decent pay, if you worry about your children's education, if you're taken care of an elderly parent. Then there's only one, only one person in this election who will help you.There's only one person in this race who will be there, who has always been there for you, and that's Hillary Clinton's life story. It's not just who she is, it's her life story. She's always there. She's always been there, and so has Tim Kaine.Ladies and gentlemen, to state the obvious and I'm not trying to be a wise guy here. I really mean it. That's not Donald Trump's story. Just listen to me a second without booing or cheering. I mean this sincerely, we should really think about this. His cynicism is unbounded.His lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in a phrase that I suspect he's most proud of having made famous, you're fired. I mean really, I'm not joking. Think about that. Think about that. Think about everything you learned as a child, no matter where you were raised. How can there be pleasure in saying, you're fired? He's trying to tell us, he cares about the middle class, give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey.I tell you.Folks, whatever, Ð ÐWhatever he thinks, whatever he thinks and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I know I'm called middle class Joe and in Washington, that's not meant as a compliment. It means you're not sophisticated. But I know why we're strong. I know why we have held together. I know why, we are united. It's because there's always been a growing middle class. This guy doesn't have a clue about the middle class, not a clue.Because, folks, when the middle class does well, when the middle class does well, the rich do very well and the poor have hope. They have a way up. He has no clue about what makes America great. Actually he has no clue period.But folks, let me Ð Ð you got it.OK. But folks, let me, let me say, let me say something that has nothing to do with politics. Let me talk about something that I am deadly serious about. This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in. The threats are too great. The times are too uncertain, to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States, now let me finish. No major party, no major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less has been less prepared to deal with our national security.We cannot elect a man who exploits are fears of ISIS and other terrorists. Who has no plan whatsoever to make us safer. A man who embraces the tactics of our enemies, torture, religious intolerance, you all know. All the Republicans know, that's not who we are. It betrays our values. It alienates those who we need in the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump, with all his rhetoric, would literally make us less safe. We cannot elect a man, who belittles are closest allies, why embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin. No, I mean that. A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain, and disorder around the world. A man who confuses bluster with strength. We simply cannot let that happen as Americans, period.Folks Ð ÐI have, no one every doubts I mean what I say. It's just that sometimes they say all that I mean. But folks, let me tell you what I literally tell every world leader I've met with and I've met them all. It's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America.We have the finest fighting force in the world. Not only Ð ÐNot only, not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world. We have the most productive workers in the world. And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever, let their country down. Never.Never. Ordinary people like us who do extraordinary things Ð ÐWe've had candidates before attempted to get elected to appealing to our fears, but they never succeeded, because we do not scare easily. We never bow, we never bend, we never break when confronted with crisis. No, we endure, we overcome and we always, always, always move forward.That's why, that's why I can say with absolute conviction, I am more optimistic about our chances today than when I was elected as a 29 year old kid to the Senate. The 21st century is going to be the American century.Because we lead by not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. That is the history of the journey of America. And God willing, God willing, Hillary Clinton will write the next chapter in that journey. We are America, second to none. And we own the finish line. Don't forget it.God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Come on. We're America. Thank you.",3,,,
Judy Chu,"I'm Congresswoman Judy Chu from California. And I am proud to be the first Chinese-American woman ever elected to Congress. Standing with me are my fellow Asian-American and Pacific Islander or AAPI members of Congress. Many of them, too, are trailblazers in their own right and we are all proud to support Hillary Clinton for president of the United States!It wasn't too long ago that if you saw an Asian Pacific American walking in the U.S Capitol, you had to stop to do a double take. But how things have changed. We now have a record number of AAPI members of Congress and most importantly, we are organizing and making our voices heard. We have gone from being marginalized to becoming the margin of victory in key swing states and districts all across our nation. America needs a president who will fight for us, someone who rejects the hateful rhetoric that is too often used to divide us and believes that America's diversity is our greatest strength. That's why we've got to elect Hillary Clinton as our next president of the United States. When it comes to the issues most important to us, Hillary Clinton gets it. On immigration reform, she gets it. So many families have been kept apart for decades by an incredibly long family visa backlog. Hillary will fight to clear that backlog so that millions of American families can finally be reunited with their loved ones. We're with Hillary because she is committed to comprehensive immigration reform. On education, she gets it. So many of our parents and grandparents sacrificed to come to the United States because they wanted their children to get a better education and live the American dream. We're with Hillary because she'll make debt free college available for all Americans. On voting rights, she gets it. Today, almost 70% of AAPI adults are foreign born. Access to translated and absentee ballots is critical. And we're with Hillary because she will work with Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and ensure fair access to the ballot box. On making sure we have a diverse federal government, she gets it. We're with Hillary because she will appoint an administration that looks like America. And on safeguarding our civil liberties, she gets it. I am so proud to have Congresswoman Doris Matsui and Congressman Mike Honda as members of our caucus. During World War II, both Doris and Mike were imprisoned in internment camps for no other reason than their ethnicity. Donald Trump doesn't seem to have a problem with this part of our history. With Hillary Clinton, we know the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans will be protected. Tonight, we are also grieving for our dear friend and colleague, Congressmember Mark Takai from Hawaii who passed away last week at the age of 49 after a hard fought battle with pancreatic cancer. Mark truly had the aloha spirit and was deeply committed to advancing the priorities of the people of Hawaii and our veterans. I will never forget the tears in his eyes when he learned about the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. It gave him and millions of Americans hope that we will finally find a cure for cancer. In his memory, we've got to keep hoping and fighting. Hillary Clinton is the best choice for all Americans to move our country forward. Our caucus members reflect a diversity of America and that is why we are proud to stand with her!",3,,,
Leon Panetta,"In this hour, in some very dangerous corners of the world, young Americans are standings guard. Our brave military and intelligence professionals are on the front lines far from home risking their lives for us, for our freedom, for our way of life.A president, a commander in chief has no greater responsibility -- no greater responsibility -then the decision to send our troops into harm's way.I have worked alongside nine presidents, Republican and Democrat, all experienced, all believing in the U.S. role in world leadership. And I can tell you this that in this election there is only one candidate for president that has the experience, the temperament, and judgment to be commander in chief and that's Hillary Clinton. This is no time -- this is no time -- to gamble with our future. America faces flash points and threats from around the globe. We need a president who's strong and smart and courageous, who enters the Oval office with the respect of the generals and admirals who lead our military, with the confidence of diplomats who represent America, and with the trust of our troops who know that she will always have their back. That president is Hillary Clinton. During my time as CIA Director and Secretary of Defense, Hillary was a strong supporter of our efforts to protect our homeland, to decimate Al Queda, and to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice. It was a tough decision to go after Bin Laden. In long meetings in the White House Situation Room, we debated that fateful decision. I presented the intelligence to the President and others laying out the risk of that operation. And when the president went around the table to our country's national security leadership, there were concerns. But Hillary was clear -- we have to go after Bin Laden. And our special operations forces, God Bless them, did just that, and they sent a clear message to the world that no one attacks the United States of America and gets away with it. Hillary is just as determined to defeat those that threaten us today Ð ISIS, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab -- terrorists who pervert the teachings of Islam to kill innocent people going about their daily lives -- people traveling through airports in Brussels and Istanbul, families celebrating on the beach front in France, men and women shopping in a market in Baghdad. And just this week and eight-five year old priest whose throat was slit by terrorists who stormed his church during mass. These murderers must be stopped. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who has laid out a comprehensive plan to defeat and destroy ISIS and keep America safe. She is smart. She is principled. She is tough. And she is ready. Hillary Clinton is the single most experienced and prepared person who has ever run for president of the United States.And meanwhile -- meanwhile -- Donald Trump says he gets his foreign policy experience from watching TV and running the Miss Universe Pageant. If only it were funny, but it is deadly serious. Donald Trump asks our troops to commit war crimes, endorses torture, spurns our allies from Europe to Asia, suggests that countries have nuclear weapons. And he praises dictators from Saddam Hussein to Vladimir Putin. Today, today, only today, only today, let me point out something that just happened today. Donald Trump, today, once again took Russia's side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics. Think about that. Think about that for a moment. Donald Trump, who wants to be president of the United States, is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of American to affect an election. As someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyber-attacks, it is inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible. I say this out of a firm concern for the future of my children and my grandchildren: Donald Trump can not become our commander in chief. In an unstable world, in an unstable world, we can not afford unstable leadership. We can not afford someone who believes America should withdraw from the world, threatens our international treaties, and violates moral principles. We can not afford an erratic finger on our nuclear weapons. This is no time to roll the dice and to gamble with America's national security or with the American dream. No time. I've lived that American dream. My parents were immigrants from Italy. They came through out Ellis Island. They made their way to California. They opened a restaurant in Monterey. I can still remember standing on a chair in the back of that restaurant washing glasses. Never could my immigrant parents have dreamed that their son would grow up to be Secretary of Defense of the most powerful military in the world. The American dream, the American dream, the American dream, the American dream that we've all been a part of has been defended in every generation by the brave men and women willing to fight and die for America. They are our greatest national treasure, and they deserve a serious commander in chief. If we care about them, if we care about our security, if we care about our freedoms, if we care about the American dream, there is only one choice: Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. God bless you and God bless our nation.",3,,,
Mark Kelly,"Thank you. Thank you, everyone. It is so great to be here in the great city of Philadelphia. And I speak to you tonight as the proud son of two New Jersey police officers, as a veteran of 39 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm, and of 25 years in the United States Navy, and as a former NASA astronaut who flew four missions into space. You know, my decades as a pilot, military officer, and astronaut gave me a unique perspective on our world. I saw our country at its best. I also saw humanity at its worst. From the cockpit of my A6 Intruder, I saw America lead the international coalition that defeated Saddam Hussein. I also saw the devastating effects of war itself. From orbit, I saw our planet as a perfect blue marble just floating there on the blackness of space. But I also saw receding glaciers and shrinking rainforests. At war and in space, I saw the awesome extent of American power and capability. But it was so frustrating to return home and see how we struggle to address some of our greatest challenges. Just as Hillary is prepared to defeat ISIS, advance our values, and protect our freedoms, Hillary is ready to take on one of our country's greatest moral failures here at home, and that is the gun violence that is tearing so many of our communities apart. We have to do better, and Hillary knows we can. Hillary knows that we can save lives by doing more to keep guns out of the wrong hands. And we know that as president she will do what is right for our nation, not what is politically expedient. She'll stand up to the Washington gun lobby that works to protect the shameful status quo. So if we want to leave our kids and grandkids a country with less gun violence, not more, then we need to make sure that Hillary Clinton is our next president. Now, I want to introduce you to somebody who is working to do just that. Someone who has taught me each and every single day to deny the acceptance of failure. Somebody who doesn't give up, and someone who believes like Hillary does that we are all stronger together. My wife -- my wife, the awesome Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords.",3,,,
Martin Omalley,"My fellow Americans, president of the United States is the toughest job in the world. And I come here before you as a man who knows Hillary Clinton well. I have worked alongside her and I have competed against her. And I'm here to tell you that Hillary Clinton is as tough as they come. She will stand up to ISIS. She will stand up to the Russians. And with Tim Kaine at her side, she will never stop fighting for our children and our families because Hillary Clinton knows when our families are strong, America is strong. Now Donald Trump -- he's a different story. He will not fight for us. He feeds off of economic fears and failures, stirs up false divisions and ancient hates, turns anger into a political weapon. But my friends, anger never fed a hungry child, did it? Anger never protected a family's home or sent a kid to college. Anger never built a great republic. I say, to hell with Trump's American nightmare! We believe in the American dream! We believe, as Hillary Clinton believes, that no American family who works hard should have to raise their children in poverty. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has actually said -- quote -- ''Wages are too high''. Wages are too high? Really, Donald? I'll tell you what's too high -- college tuition is too high. I'll tell you what's too high -- the cost of child care, that's too high. The number of American children who live in poverty -- that's too high. Donald Trump's opinion of himself -- that's way too high. You see, actually Donald, American wages, in fact, are too low. Our economy isn't money. It is people. It is all of our people. And Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will fight to make sure that every family who's willing to work hard can actually get ahead again in America. On climate change, like you and me -- and in fact, like our children and grandchildren -- Hillary Clinton believes in science. She understands that climate change is not only a real threat, it's also the greatest job creation opportunity to come to the United States in a hundred years. Now Donald Trump, on the other hand, does not believe in science. He says -- and again I quote -- ''The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese''. I'll tell you what, if the Chinese were really capable of designing some kind of diabolical farce to hurt America, they wouldn't invent global warming; they'd invent Donald Trump. This much we know for sure: Donald Trump has been a bully his whole life. But here's what I learned in elementary school on the playgrounds -- bullies are really just cowards in disguise. The America we love does not engage in torture. The America we love does not build walls and shameful for-profit prisons. The America we love does not lock up women and children in disgraceful immigrant detention camps. Unlike that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton understands the enduring symbol of the United States of America is not the barbwire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty. And so my fellow Democrats, anger and fear had their moment last week, but now it is our time. Time to stand up for each other, stand up for our shared promise, stand up for the goodness and the hope in every American heart. It's time to put a bully racist in his place and a tough woman in hers -- the White House! Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, forward together, stronger together! The country we carry in our hearts is waiting!",3,,,
Michael Bloomberg,"Kasim, thank you for that kind introduction. Let me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech.Now, I'm not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform. I am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why I believe it is my imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. And to ask you to join with me in supporting her this November.When the Founding Fathers arrived here in Philadelphia to forge a new nation, they didn't come as Democrats or Republicans, or to nominate a presidential candidate. They came as patriots who feared party politics. I know how they felt. I've been a Democrat, I've been a Republican, and I eventually became an independent because I don't believe either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.When I enter the voting booth each time, I look at the candidate, not the party label. I have supported elected officials from both sides of the aisle. Probably not many people in this room can say that, but I know there are many watching at home who can. And now, they are carefully weighing their choices. I understand their dilemma.I know what it's like to have neither party fully represent my views or values. Too many Republicans wrongly blame immigrants for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on climate change and gun violence. Meanwhile, many Democrats wrongly blame the private sector for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on education reform and deficit reduction.There are times when I disagree with Hillary. But whatever our disagreements may be, I've come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country. And we must united around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue.I believe it's the duty of all American citizens to make our voices heard by voting in this election. And, if you're not yet registered to vote, go online. Do it now. It's just too important to sit this out.Now, we've heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn't agree more. I've built a business and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father. Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America's largest city for 12 years, governing in the wake of its greatest tragedy.Today, as an independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem solver, not a bomb thrower. Someone who can bring members of Congress together, to get things done. And I know Hillary Clinton can do that because I saw it firsthand.I was elected mayor two months after 9/11, as a Republican Ñ and I saw how Hillary Clinton worked with Republicans in Washington to ensure that New York got the help it needed to recover and rebuild. Throughout her time in the Senate, we didn't always agree Ñ but she always listened. And that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today, and it just has to start in the White House.Given my background, I've often encouraged business leaders to run for office because many of them share that same pragmatic approach to building consensus, but not all. Most of us who have created a business know that we're only as good as the way our employees, clients, and partners view us. Most of us don't pretend that we're smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we're only as good as our word. But not Donald Trump.Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us.I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What'd I miss here?!Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts.We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does.I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump's business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can't afford to make that choice.Now, I know Hillary Clinton is not flawless; no candidate is. But she is the right choice Ñ and the responsible choice Ñ in this election. No matter what you may think about her politics or her record, Hillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality. She understands the job of president. It involves finding solutions, not pointing fingers, and offering hope, not stoking fear.Over the course of our country's proud history, we have faced our share of grave challenges, but we have never retreated in fear. Never. Not here in Philadelphia in 1776, not at Gettysburg in 1863, not through two World Wars and a Great Depression, not at Selma or Stonewall, and not after 9/11 Ñ and we must not start now.America is the greatest country on Earth Ñ and when people vote with their feet, they come here. The presidency of the United States is the most powerful office in the world, and so I say to my fellow independents: Your vote matters now. Your vote will determine the future of your job, your business, and our future together as a country.To me, this election is not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. It's a choice about who is better to lead our country right now: better for our economy, better for our security, better for our freedom, and better for our future.There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the right choice this November. So tonight, as an independent, I am asking you to join with me Ñ not out of party loyalty but out of love of country. And together, let's elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America.Thank you.",3,,,
Stephanie Schriock,"100 years ago, this November, a social worker from my home state of Montana, Jeannette Rankin, became the first woman ever elected to Congress. The first but not the last. Once that barrier fell, there was no turning back. And over 31 years, EMILY's List has helped elect hundreds more women to the House and the Senate and every other office on the ballot -- except one. Hillary Clinton may be our first woman president but she will not be our last. Once that barrier falls, it will never, ever, ever be put back up. The women we've elected haven't just brought new voices to the debate, they've brought new momentum to the progressive movement. You see, women don't just fight for women; they fight for families, they fight for fairness, inclusion, justice. No wonder Republican leaders oppose equal pay for women and refuse to stand up for working mothers trying to balance career and family. That's why they'd let your boss fire you for using birth control and force us to undergo invasive trans-vaginal ultrasounds. They don't respect women. They don't trust women. They want to control women. They're afraid of the change we bring, the progress we make when we get a chance to lead. And they're terrified of Hillary Clinton because no matter what they throw at her, they've never ever been able to stop her. From the Children's Defense Fund to the Senate, from Little Rock to Beijing, she's fought for fairness, for inclusion, for justice, and she's won. Now, they're making their last stand, not just against her, but against all of us who have worked so hard and so long to make progress in America. They're panicking. They're desperate and that means they're dangerous. They've nominated a man who said, ''Women should be punished for having an abortion.'' Said, ''Putting a wife to work is a dangerous thing.'' Called us ''fat pigs'' and ''animals''. He picked a running mate who led the fight to destroy Planned Parenthood, tried to re-define rape, suggested that mothers who work stunt the emotional growth of their kids by putting them in day care. If they win, they'll erase every ounce of progress we've dared to make. But we have fought too hard and come too far to let that happen. Let's stand together to elect more Democratic women up and down the ballots, more women in local office, more women in the House, more women in the Senate and enough to take the majority. Let's decide right here and now to break through that last barrier, and yes, at long last, put a woman in the White House! Hillary Clinton, our first woman president but not our last!",3,,,
Tim Kaine,"Thank you everybody. Hello, Philadelphia!Hello Democratic families.I want to start off by thanking my beautiful wife and my three wonderful children, Nat, Woody, and Annella. They are sitting right up there.You Know my son, Nat, deployed with his Marine battalion just two days ago.He deployed overseas to protect and defend the very NATO allies that Donald Trump says he now wants to abandon.Semper fi, Nat! Semper fi!My parents and my in-laws are here. Our siblings and their spouses. Our nieces and nephews, and hundreds of friends from Virginia and beyond.I love seeing you front and center. Including my friend of 37 years, senior Senator Mark Warner. My great Governor Terry McAuliffe.And my great friend and Congressman Bobby Scott.We love you all.Today, for my wife Anne and every strong woman in this country, for Nat, Woody, and Annella, and every young person starting out in life to make their own dreams real, for every man and woman serving our country in the military at home or abroad, for every working family working hard to get ahead and stay ahead, for my parents and in-laws and every senior citizen who hopes for a dignified retirement with health care and research to end diseases like Alzheimer's.For every American who wants our country to be a beloved community where people are not demeaned because of who they are but rather respected for their contributions to this nation, and for all of us who know that the brightest future for our country is the one that we build together, and for my friend, Hillary Clinton, I humbly accept my party's nomination to be vice president of the United States.Thank you.Can I be honest with you about something? Can I be honest with you about something? I never expected to be here. But let me tell you how it happened, I was born in Minnesota and grew up in Kansas City.My folks were not much into politics. My dad ran a union iron- working shop in the stockyards.And my mom was his best salesman. My two brothers and I pitched in to work during summers and weekends. And, you know, that is how small family businesses do it.My parents, Al and Kathy, here tonight and going strong, they taught me about hard work and about kindness and most especially, about faith. I went to a Jesuit boys high school, Rockhurst High School.Wow, that's a big line for the Jesuits.Now we had a motto in my school, ''men for others.'' And it was there that my faith became something vital. My north star for orienting my life. And when I left high school, I knew that I wanted to battle for social justice.Like so many of you. Like so many of you.That is why I took a year off from law school to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I taught kids how to be welders and carpenters. (SPEAKING SPANISH), faith, family, and work. Faith, family, and work. (SPEAKING SPANISH).And let me tell you what really struck me there, I got a firsthand look at a different system. A dictatorship. A dictatorship where a few people at the top had all the power and everybody else got left out.Now that convinced me that we have got to advance opportunity for everybody, no matter where you come from, how much money you have, what you look like, how you worship or who you love.Back in 1970, in Virginia, a Republican governor named Linwood Holton believed exactly the same thing. He integrated Virginia's public schools so that black and white kids could finally learn together. And then the family enrolled their own kids, including his daughter, Anne, in those integrated inner city schools.Many years later Anne went off to college and she brought those lessons from that pivotal time with her. And then one day, in a study group, she met this goofy guy who had been off teaching kids in Honduras.Well, Anne and I have now been married almost 32 years and I am the luckiest husband in the world.You know, let me tell you something, Anne's parents, Lin and Jinks, are here today, 90-plus and going strong.Ninety-plus and going strong. Linwood Holton, he is still a Republican but he is voting for an awful lot of Democrats these days. An awful lot of Democrats.And here is why, he is voting for Democrats because any party that would nominate Donald Trump for president has moved too far away from his party of Lincoln.And I'll tell you, if any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln, we have got a home for you right here in the Democratic Party.Linwood's example helped inspire me as a civil rights lawyer. Over 17 years I took on banks, landlords, real estate firms, local governments, anybody who treated anybody unfairly.I had a six-year case against an insurance company that was discriminating against minority neighborhoods all across the United States in issuing homeowner's insurance.Folks, Democratic friends, these are the battles that I have fought my entire life.And that is the story Ñ and that is the story of how I decided to run for office. My city of Richmond was divided and discouraged in the early 1990s. We had an epidemic of gun violence that was overwhelming our low-income neighborhoods.People were pointing fingers and casting blame instead of finding answers. And I couldn't stand it. So I ran for city council and I won that first race more than 20 years ago by a landslide margin of 94 votes.And I've said ever since, if I'm good at anything in politics, it's because I started at the local level listening to people, learning about their lives, and trying to get results. I see a mayor here who knows what I'm talking about.Later I became mayor of Richmond, lieutenant governor, and then the 70th governor of Virginia.Now, I was a hard times governor. I had to steer my state through the deepest recession since the 1930s. But hey, tough times don't last and tough people do. And can I tell you that Virginians are tough people? We are tough people.And we are smart, too . We achieved national recognition for our work, best-managed state, best state for business, best state for a child to be raised, low unemployment, high median income.We shed tears along the way. We shed tears especially together in the days after that horrible mass shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people from beautiful 19-year-old students to 70-plus-year- old Romanian-born Holocaust survivors, and we shed tears and held each other up, but afterwards we rolled up our sleeves and we fixed the loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer. And we got have to do that in the nation. We invested in our people expanding pre-K and higher ed., because we all know in this room that education is the key to all we want to be, all we want to be.And now I have the honor of representing my commonwealth in the US Senate. I work on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees to keep us safe at home and strong in the world.I work on the Budget Committee with our great Democratic leader of that committee, a spectacular senator who used to be a mayor, Vermont's Bernie Sanders.And, everybody, we all should feel the Bern and we all should not want to get burned by the other guy.On that Budget Committee under Bernie's leadership, we fight for investments in education, health care, research, transportation. And I also serve on the Aging Committee to make sure that seniors like my folks have a secure retirement and don't get targeted by rip-off artists who will scam them out of their savings or overcharge them for prescription drugs.Can I tell you a funny thing about the Senate? Can I tell you a funny thing about the Senate?That sounds like a yes. I spend a lot of time with Republican senators who, once they have made sure that nobody is listening, will tell you how fantastic a senator that Hillary Clinton was.Now, look, this journey that I've told you about has convinced me, has convinced me over and over again that God has created in our country a beautiful and rich tapestry, an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everybody in love and battle back against the forces, the dark forces of division.We are all neighbors. And we must love neighbors as ourselves.Now Hillary Clinton and I are companeros de alma.And we share this basic belief, it's simple. Do all the good you can and serve one another. Pretty simple. Pretty simple.That is what I'm about. That is what you are about. That is what Bernie Sanders is about. That is what Joe and Jill Biden are about. That is what Barack and Michelle Obama are about. And that is what Hillary Clinton is about.Si se puede, si se puede, si se puede.Yes we can. Yes we can. Yes we can.Hey, last week, last week in Cleveland we heard a lot about trust. So let's talk about trust. Let's talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.First, she's consistent. She has battled to put kids and families first since she was a teenager. In good times and bad. In victory and defeat. In and out of office.Through hell or high water, fighting for underprivileged kids working at the Children's Defense Fund. Fighting to get health insurance for 8 million low-income children when she was first lady. Fighting for the well-being of women and children around the world. Hey, can offer you a little tip? When you want to know something about the character of somebody in public life, look to see if they have a passion that began long before they were in office, and that they have consistently held it throughout their career.Do they have a passion? Did it start before they were in office? Have they held on to it consistently? Folks, Hillary has a passion for kids and families.Donald Trump has a passion too, it's himself.And with Hillary, it is not just words, it's accomplishments. She delivers. As senator, after 9/11 I got my New Yorkers right here and my Virginians right here. She battled Ñ she battled congressional Republicans to care for the first responders who went in to the Towers, who went in to the Pentagon and saved the victims of those terrorist attacks.As secretary of state, she implemented tough sanctions against Iran to pave the way for a diplomatic breakthrough to curtail a nuclear weapons program. And she wasn't afraid, she wasn't afraid. She was not afraid to stand up against thugs and dictators, and as a key part of the Obama national security team, they decided to go to the ends of the earth to wipe out Osama bin Laden.Hey, do you all remember Carla (ph), the little girl that we heard from on Monday night, who was worried that her parents would be deported? Carla said she trusts Hillary to keep them together.And do you remember the Mothers of the Movement last night?They said they trust Hillary to keep other mothers' sons and daughters safe.And on a personal level, as he is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son's life.Now you know who I don't trust? Hmm, I wonder. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Trump is a guy who promises a lot but, you may have noticed, he has got a way of saying the same two words every time he makes his biggest, hugest promises.''Believe me.'' It's going to be great, believe me. We are going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for, believe me.We are going to destroy ISIS so fast, believe me.There is nothing suspicious and my tax returns, believe me.By the way, does anybody in this massive auditorium believe that Donald Trump has been paying his fair share of taxes?Does anybody here believe that Trump ought to release his tax returns just like every other presidential candidate in modern history?Of course he should. Hey, Donald, what are you hiding? And yet, Donald still says, believe me. Believe me.Believe me? Believe me? I mean, here's the thing, most people when they run for president, they don't just say, believe me, they respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done.I mean, that is what most people who run for president do. In fact, you can go on hillaryclinton.com right now and find out exactly how she will make the biggest investment in new jobs in a generation.How she will defend and build on Wall Street reform. How she will reform our immigration system to create a path to citizenship. How she will make it possible to graduate from college debt-free.You can see how she will protect Roe versus Wade, guarantee equal pay for women, and make paid family leave a reality.All it takes is one click. All it takes is one click. And we can see how she will do it, how she will pay for it, and how we will benefit by it.Not Donald Trump. Not Donald Trump. He never tells you how he is going to do any of the things he says he will do. He just says, believe me.So here's the question, here's the question, do you really believe him?I mean, Donald Trump's whole career says you had better not. Small contractors, companies just like my dad's believed him, believed him when he said that he would pay them to build a casino in Atlantic City.They do the work. They hung the drywall. They poured the concrete. But a year after opening, Trump filed for bankruptcy, he walked away with millions, and they got pennies on the dollar.Some of them went out of business. All because they believed Donald Trump.Retirees and families in Florida, they believed Donald Trump when he said that he would build up some condos. Thousands of them. They paid their deposits but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away.They lost tens of thousands of dollars all because they believed Donald Trump. Charity after charity believed Donald Trump when he said they would contribute to them. And thousands of Trump University students believed Donald Trump when he said he would help them succeed.They got stiffed.He says, believe me. Well, his creditors, his contractors, his laid-off employees, and his ripped-off students did just that and they all got hurt.Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.Not one word. Not one word. Not one word.And I will tell you, and I will tell you, to me, it just seems like our nation, it is just too great to put in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting one-man wrecking crew.But don't take it from me, don't take it from me. Take it from former first lady Barbara Bush. Barbara Bush said she doesn't know how any woman could vote for him after his offensive comments about women.Any woman. Any woman. Or John McCain's chief economic adviser during the '08 race, who estimates that Donald Trump's promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs.Or the independent analysts who found that Trump's tax plan given to the wealthy and the biggest corporations would rack up $30 trillion in debt.Or how about this? How about this? John Kasich, the Republican governor who had the honor of hosting the Republican Convention in Cleveland, but he wouldn't even attend it because he thinks Donald Trump is such a moral disaster.Or take it from the guy who co-wrote Donald Trump's autobiography, here is what he said about Trump, quote, ''lying is second nature to him.'' So do you believe him?I don't know, how about on this side, do you guys believe him?I mean, do you guys believe him?Is there anyone in this building who believes him?The next president will face many challenges, we had better elect a candidate who has proven she can be trusted with the job.The candidate who has proven that she is ready for the job. And when I say ready, I use ready for a specific reason. When I lived in Honduras, I learned something. The best compliment that you could pay to somebody was to say that they were listo. Ready. Not inteligente, smart. Not amable, friendly. Not rico, rich. But listo, listo.Because what listo means in Spanish is this, it means prepared, it means battle-tested, it means rock solid, up for anything, never backing down. And, friends, Hillary Clinton, she is listo!Hillary Clinton is listo.She is ready. She is ready, she is ready because of her faith. She is because of her heart. She is ready because of her experience. And she is ready because she knows that in America, we are stronger when we are together.My fellow Democrats, this week we start the next chapter in our great and proud story. Thomas disclaimed all men were equal and Abigail remembered the women. Woodrow brokered the peace and Eleanor broke down the barriers. Jack told us what to ask and Lyndon answered the call.Martin had a dream and Cesar y Dolores said si se puede. And Harvey gave his life. Bill, Bill built a bridge into the 21st Century and Barack gave us hope. And now Hillary is ready! She is ready to fight! She is ready to win! And she is ready to lead!God bless all of you, onto victory. And thank you, Philadelphia!",3,,,
Andrew Cuomo,"Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, Democrats. Is this a great Convention or what? I would like to begin Ñ with your permission, I would like to begin this evening by acknowledging my father who we lost last year. He was a twelve-year Governor of the State of New York, Mario Cuomo. He gave a keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention Ñ instructed me how to lead, and he loved being a Democrat. The 1984 election was important because it was more about two opposing philosophies, more than two people. Even more profoundly, at stake this November, is not which person or party wins or loses Ð at stake in this election, my friends, is the very soul of America. Now, last week we heard the Republicans lay out their strategy Ñ unfortunately it offered no new solutions. But it's clear that their plan is to fan the flames of fear and to offer a scapegoat for all our problems. The Trump campaign Ñ the Trump campaign is marketing a great distraction, using people's fear and anxiety to drive his ratings. Their message comes down to this: be afraid of people who are different Ñ be afraid of different religions and different colors and different languages. Stop immigration and they believe the nation will automatically rise. It's not right, it's divisive, it's delusional, and we must expose the truth to the people of this nation. Now, Republicans are suffering from short-term memory loss. Unless Republicans are all Native Americans, then they are immigrants too. If we listen to the Republicans, they would cut this nation in half, and turn one against the other. It would take our greatest strength, our diversity, and it would make it a weakness and we are not going to let that happen to our America. Now, my friends, fear is a powerful weapon. It can excite and motivate and it can get people to yell and scream. Fear can even bring you into power. But fear has never created a job, and fear has never educated a child, and fear has never built a home, and fear has never built a community, and fear will never build a nation. Let them remember: when they set out fear, fear is not strength Ñ fear is weakness Ñ no matter how loud you yell Ñ and our America is never weak. Republicans say they want to make America great again. They say they want to to take us back to the old days Ð the good old days. I want to know what good old days they want to take us back to. Do they want to take us back before the Civil Rights Act? Before minimum wage and worker protection laws? Or do they want to take us back before Roe v. Wade?  We have a different vision for this nation Ð we're not going back. We're going forward. They say Ð they say they want to make America great than ever before, we say you haven't seen anything yet. You watch what we're going to do with America. You think America is great now? You think America is great now Ð imagine how great America can be when every child, rich and poor, is fully educated to their God-given talents. Let's be honest Ð right now in this country we have two education systems. Not public and private, but rich and poor. You go to school on a rich side of town, they'll show in the first grade all the children are on laptop computers. You go to school on the poor side of town and you'll see the most sophisticated piece of electronic equipment is the metal detector that you walk through on the way to the classroom. That is not educating every child equally. You think Ð you think America is strong. Imagine how strong America will be when we truly heed Martin Luther King's wisdom and we judge people by content of character and not color of skin. Imagine how strong we will be when we understand that the greatest feast is the one that is enjoyed by the most people at the table. Imagine how strong we will be when our government has the strength to fight for freedom, but the intelligence to know that the strongest four letter word is not hate but love. We know what Republicans will say that Democrats are dreamers. We are dreamers, but we are also doers. FDR lifted a nation from its knees, JFK launched our mission to the moon, LBJ enacted voting rights for all Americans. President Obama delivered health coverage for 20 million uninsured Americans. Mario Cuomo was a dreamer too, but our progressive government is working. We raised the minimum wage to 15 dollars because we insist on economic justice. We enacted paid family leave because all workers deserve dignity. We are rebuilding our middle class and we are working hand in hand with organized labor because the middle class is the backbone of this society. We are protecting the environment by banning fracking because this is the only planet we have. We fought the NRA and we won and we outlawed assault weapons to keep them from the hands of madmen who are killing innocents. We passed marriage equality and GENDA. We did it not because the Supreme Court said we must legally, but because people believed that we should morally. Now, these are not dreams. These are realities. Progressive government works and we proved that progress government works. We did it together Ñ without leaving anyone out or anyone behind because we believe that we are interconnected and we are all interrelated. We say, ''somos uno'' Ñ we are one. We say there is a cord that connects you to you, and you to you. Maybe you can't see it, but it's there and it weaves the fabric of community and when one of us is raised we're all raised and when one of us is lowered we're all lowered. The Republicans say our vision of community is not possible Ñ but we know it is. We've seen it happen and we've seen it close. Fifteen years ago on September 11 we saw death and destruction Ð unimaginable horror and cruelty Ñ but we saw something else, my friends. We saw this nation come together like it had never come together before. We were not Texans, Californians or New Yorkers. We weren't Democrats Republicans or Independents. We weren't Muslims, Christians or Jews. We were Americans. We weren't black, or white or brown Ñ we were red, and white and blue, and those are the only colors that matter in the United States of America. In that moment, we were one. We achieved community. We were there for each other. We were there the way a family is there. We cried together, we mourned together, and then we got up and we rebuilt together. That was America at its best. Today Ð today the freedom tower stands taller than ever before, and it is a monument to the fact that there is nothing that we can't do. We say, ''E pluribus unum'' Ñ out of many, one. This is our founding premise and our enduring promise. That is our goal for this nation and Hillary Clinton is the person to make that goal a reality. I spent eight years in the Clinton administration and worked with Hillary every day. I've been all over the world with her. I've seen her in the trenches and in the good days and bad. She stood on the world stage and declared that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights. She fought for healthcare for all Americans. As Secretary of State, she repaired America's reputation worldwide. My friends, she won't just shatter the glass ceiling for my daughters and your daughters, and provide a new role model for an entire generation of women. She also has the vision, intelligence and qualifications to be a transformative force for this nation. She will unify, not divide this nation and move us forward together as one. That's why we must make Hillary Clinton the next President of these United States of America.  And last point, my friends: that was the essence of my father's timeless message in 1984. That message is timeless. My father was the keynote speaker for this nation's better angels, and he was beautiful. And tonight, Pop, wherever you are, and I think I know where, at this time of fear, help this country remember what truly makes it great: that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.",,,,
Beth Mathia,"My name is Beth Mathias, and four months ago, Hillary Clinton sat with me in a doughnut shop in Marion, Ohio, and she asked to hear my story.I told her that my husband and I work three jobs just to make ends meet. Between us, we work for 24 hours a day. We only see each other when we pass each other in the doorway Ñ when one of us is coming home, and the other is leaving.And I only see my kids when they're already in bed. I get home too late to spend any quality time with them. Our life is consumed by work, but we're still crushed by debt: medical, student loans. We have no savings.We work hard, and yet it feels like the world is against us. But I told Hillary Clinton that even though every day is a struggle, we don't want a handout. We want a hand to help us up.And she understood, because she believes that America is strongest when we look out for one another; when no one who works full time has to choose between making a car payment and feeding their children.That's why I'm here Ñ taking time off from both of my jobs Ñ to ask you to put in the time to elect Hillary Clinton and help make life better for me and millions of people just like me.I believe we can do it. And I believe in Hillary Clinton.Thank you.",,,,
Chelsea Clinton,"It is such an honor for me to be here tonight. I'm here as a proud American, a proud Democrat, a proud mother. And tonight, in particular, and very proud daughter.Mark and I can't quite believe it, but our daughter Charlotte is nearly two years old. She loves Elmo, she loves blueberries and above all, she loves Facetiming with Grandma. My mom can be about to walk on stage and it just does not matter, she will drop everything for a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading ''Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo'' with her granddaughter. Our son, Aidan, is five and a half weeks old. We are so thankful that he is healthy and thriving and we are biased, but we think he is just about the cutest baby in the world Ñ a view I'm sure my mom shares. And every day that I spend with them as Charlotte and Aidan's mother, I think about my own mother. My wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious mother.My earliest memory is my mom picking me up after I had fallen down, giving me a big hug, and reading me ''Goodnight Moon.'' From that moment to this one Ñ every single memory I have of my mom is that regardless of what was happening in her life, she was always there for me. Every soccer game, every softball game, every piano recital, every dance recital. Sundays spent together at church, the local library, countless Saturdays finding shapes in the clouds.Making up stories about what we would do if we met a Triceratops Ñ in my opinion, the friendliest looking dinosaur Ñ although my mother would remind me that they were still dinosaurs. As a kid I was pretty obsessed with dinosaurs and the day that my parents took me to Dinosaur National Park, I didn't think life could get any better.Whenever my mom was away for work, which thankfully did not happen very often, she let notes for me to open every day she was gone. All stacked neatly together in a special drawer with a date on the front of each one, so I would know which note to open on which day. When she went to France to learn about the childcare system, I remember one was all about the Eiffel Tower. Another was about that ideas she helped to bring home to help the kids of Arkansas. I treasured each and every one of those notes. They were another reminder that I was always in her thoughts and in her heart.Growing up, conversations around the dinner table always started with what I learned in school that day. I remember one week talking incessantly about a book that had captured my imagination, ''A Wrinkle in Time.'' Only after my parents had listened to me talk, would they then talk about what they were working on: education, health care consuming their days and keeping them up at night.I love that my parents expected me to have opinions and to be able to back them up with facts. I never once doubted that my parents cared about my thoughts and my ideas, and I always knew how deeply they love me. That feeling of being valued and loved Ñ that is what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life.My parents raised me to know how lucky I was that I never had to worry about food on the table, that I never had to worry about a good school to go to. Never had to worry about a safe neighborhood to play in. And they taught me to care about what happens in the world. And to do whatever I can to change what frustrated me, what felt wrong. They taught me that's the responsibility that comes with being smiled on by fate.I know my kids are little young, but I'm already trying to instill those same values in them. There's something else that my mother taught me: public service is about service. And as her daughter, I've had a special window into how she serves. I've seen her holding the hands of mothers worried about how they will feed their kids, worried about how they will get them the healthcare they need. My mother promised to do everything she could to help. I have seen her right after those conversations getting straight to work. Figuring out what she could do, who she could call. How fast she could get results. She always feels like there isn't a moment to lose because she knows that for that mother, for that family, there isn't.And I've seen her at the low points, like the summer of 1994. Several people this week have talked about her fight for universal health care. I saw it up close. It was bruising. It was exhausting. She fought her heart out and as all of you know, she lost. For me, 14 years old, it was pretty tough to watch. But my mom, she was amazing. She took a little time to replenish her spirit Ñ family movie night definitely helped. Dad, as all of you know, liked ''Police Academy.'' My mom and I loved ''Pride and Prejudice.'' And then she got right back to work. Because she believed she could still make a difference for kids.People ask me all the time Ñ how does she do it? How does she keep going amid the sound and politics? Here is how: she never, ever forgets who she is fighting for.She has worked to make it easier for foster kids to get adopted. For 9/11 first responders to get the health care they deserve. For women around the world to be safe, to be treated with dignity, and to have more opportunity. Fights like these, they are what keep my mother going. They grabbed her heart. Her conscience. And they never let go. That is to my mom. She's a listener, a doer. She is a woman driven by compassion, by faith, but a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love.Come this November, I'm voting for a woman as a role model and a mother. A woman who has spent her entire life fighting for families and children. I'm voting for the Progressive who will protect our planet from climate change, who will reform our criminal justice system, who knows that women's rights are human rights, and who knows that LGBT rights are human rights. Here at home, and around the world, I'm voting for a fighter who never ever gives up and who believes we can always do better when we come together and work together.I hope that my children will someday be as proud of me as I am of my mom. I am so grateful to be her daughter. I'm so grateful that she is Charlotte and Aidan's grandmother. She makes me proud every single day. And mom, grandma would be so proud of you tonight.To everyone watching here at home, I know with all my heart that my mother will make us proud as our next president.",,,,
Dave Wils,"Like generations of Americans, I've always dreamed about making that proud walk across a graduation stage to get my college degree.In 2005, that dream came true at Grand Valley State University, which prepared me to do what I love Ð teach back home at North Carolina.Then came the bill -- $40,000 in student debt and all the anxiety and struggle that comes with it.Now, teaching offers so many rewards. A big salary isn't one of them.The $300 check I write every month represents savings I can't put away, car repairs I can't make, medical costs I have to put off. And with my wife, Amanda, in school after taking time off to help care for her sick mother, another $30,000 bill is on the way.Life feels like we're running on a treadmill. No matter how hard we try, we can't get ahead.And I'm not alone. Student debt has more than doubled in the last decade and now exceeds $1.2 trillion.None of us are looking for guaranteed success Ð just a fair chance at it. And that's why I'm so proud to support Hillary Clinton for president of the United States.She's going to make college debt-free for all and she's going to help millions of people like me, with existing debt, save thousands of dollars.Now, I don't know her. But, it feels like she knows me.Hillary Clinton has our backs. Let's have hers in November.Thank you very much!",,,,
Dolores Huerta,"Hola! Hola! Donald Trump: Basta! Abajo! Abajo!Like Hillary Clinton, I have spent my life fighting for human rights Ñ for women, for workers, for immigrants, for every person that does not have a voice. And with Donald Trump on the ballot, hey, we cannot be quiet.He insults Latinos like we're second-class citizens Ñ like we're newcomers to this country. Hey, I've got news for Donald Trump. Okay? Because we have been here all along. We helped build this country and we're still continuing to build this country.My great-grandfather, Marshall St. John, he was in the Civil War on the Union side. My father, Juan Fernndez, was a farm worker, an accountant, an assemblyman, and a U.S. veteran like Csar Chvez. And my son continues that tradition because he is running for the U.S. Congress from Bakersfield, California. Now, listen to this, 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year and their contributions to Social Security and Medicare -- they are going to ensure that our seniors have that safety net. So, we're not a footnote in the American story. We are actually helping write this history! Okay?And we're going to take our Latino power and we're going to use it this November. Because our votes will increase paychecks. Our votes will get immigration reform. Our votes will secure reproductive rights for women.But we have to be active Democrats because every Democrat needs to be an activist. We have to use every single minute to have it be an organizing moment. We have to use every single moment to make sure to get the voters ready so they can vote, so we can educate them, so we can knock on the doors. And hey, we've got to make sure everybody get involved in this election.  Please remind everybody -- election day is the most important day of our life. Remember this. I've known and worked with Hillary for 25 years, and I have worked with her. And this is why I trust her. During my lifetime, Hillary and the Democratic Party, they have always stood with us, the Latino community.With an experienced and visionary leader like Hillary, see, we've got to put her in the driver's seat. And with her co-pilot, Tim Kaine, you know what? They will drive us on that journey for justice and equality.But, you know, she can't do it alone. We have got to be the energy. We have got to be the wheels. And she can't go forward without us.And Donald Trump, you need to get out of the way. And if he doesn't, we need to take him out of the way.So we will show Donald Trump and his Republican friends who's got the power.I'm going to ask you: Who's got the power?What kind of power?Okay, so let's use that voting power in November. Can we do it? S Se Puede.Thank you very much!",,,,
Doug Elmets,"It's an honor to be here. Candidly, it's also a shock. Not because of the momentous nature of this event, or the size of the crowd.It's a shock because, unlike many of you, I'm a Republican.Forty years ago, I cast my first vote for president, voting Republican that day like I would do time and again.I haven't just voted Republican. I worked in President Reagan's White House.I recently led an effort to place a statue of Ronald Reagan in California's Capitol.I'm here tonight to say: I knew Ronald Reagan; I worked for Ronald Reagan. Donald Trump, you are no Ronald Reagan.President Reagan famously said, ''Tear down this wall.'' Trump says, ''Build the wall,'' because that will ''Make America Great Again.''Reagan saw nuance. Trump sees the world as us versus them, where somebody with brown skin or a foreign-sounding name is likely to blame for our troubles.Reagan knew that a leader needs diplomacy to steer a safe, prosperous course forward. Trump is a petulant, dangerously unbalanced reality star who will coddle tyrants and alienate allies.I shudder to think where he might lead our great nation. Fortunately, I don't believe he'll get that chance.While Hillary holds many policy positions that differ from my own, her qualifications are indisputable.Hillary knows that our strength as a nation lies in uniting, not dividing.This year's Republican platform is the most alarming I've ever seen. It's laced with anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-women positions that do not represent the views of most Americans.That is why this year, I will vote for a Democrat for the first time.To my fellow Republicans: If you believe like I do, you believe loyalty to our country is more important than loyalty to party, if you want a president with good judgment, a steady hand, and a temperament to represent our nation to the world and our children, I ask you join me in voting for Hillary Clinton as president of the United States.Thank you.",,,,
Emanuel Cleaver,"Thank you. Thank you. Let me begin by issuing a heartfelt invitation to our Republican friends: If your party is no longer becoming to you, then you should be coming to us. I've known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. And let me tell you, she's never let me down. And she won't let you down either.In spite of what you heard last week, it is not midnight in America. Midnights can be cold and crippling. And President Obama did not leave us in the cold and we're certainly not crippling. In reality, the sun has barely risen over the vastness of these United States. It is dawn in America and we are in the process of becoming. Yes, if you want to say what the Bible says, we are not yet what we shall become.At a time when the citizens of this amazing country are jittery over a multitude of fears and heartaches, we need a leader who will become a trafficker in optimism and a peace peddler. Hillary will build a future we can all be part of and proud of.There's an old story about Andrew Jackson. As a child, he looked like anything but a future general or president. In fact, one of his boyhood friends said that Jim Brown who lived in the same area, could throw Andrew to the ground three times out of four in wrestling matches. Years later, a writer asked, ''Why was there four matches? Jim should have won since in wrestling, if a person is thrown three times, it's all over. They lose. So what happened?'' The friend said, ÓWell, Jim would throw ole Andy but he'd get right up because Andy just wouldn't stay throwed Ð he wouldn't stay throwed!''Now, the first person in history who wouldn't stay throwed was a little baby born in Bethlehem of Judea. And that baby grew up, created a tumult. They put him in a grave and three days later, the world knew he wouldn't stay throwed. Now, here's a warning to those who might be tempted to spend the next four years trying to knock Hillary Clinton down: You'd better get ready for a woman who won't stay throwed.They threw her down as the First Lady, but she wouldn't stay throwed.They threw her down as a U.S. Senator, but she wouldn't stay throwed.They threw her down as a Secretary of State, but she wouldn't stay throwed.They threw her down in this very campaign -- this campaign -- but she won't stay throwed.No, she won't stay throwed. No, she won't stay throwed. She won't stay throwed. You better listen to me. I say she won't stay throwed.",,,,
Eric Garcetti,"Good evening. It's great to be here from Los Angeles.Los Angeles is a city with such a huge, thriving Latino population that we expect Donald Trump to build a wall around us.I'm a proud American and as I  traveled around this country, from the Midwest, where my wife was from, to the South, where I became a Navy officer, to towns across the Southwest I visited during this campaign, I heard Americans anxious about their future. And after last week's convention in Cleveland, I can understand why.There, instead of ideas, it was insults. Instead of policy, it was polarization. Instead of hope, it was hatred.As a mayor, I'm here to tell you: America's cities don't have time for theatrics. America's cities have urgent problems to solve. That's why local leaders across America support Hillary Clinton, and that's why we understands that she will help us do the work -- the urgent work -- of America. In Los Angeles, we've looked at America's crumbling infrastructure and we are fixing it Ð putting more than 500,000 people and $50 billion to work rebuilding and repairing our roads and building our port, airport, and our infrastructure.In Los Angeles, we saw too many Americans living in poverty, so we became the biggest city in America to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, inspiring other cities and states to follow.In Los Angeles, we saw too many lives lost to gun violence, so we banned high-capacity magazines and we are taking illegal guns off our streets.In Los Angeles, we saw too many high school dropouts, too many graduates in debt, so we are making community college free.We didn't do any of this by finding a common enemy. We found a common purpose. America doesn't need a political pyromaniac for president.Donald Trump has no vision for our country and no genuine answer to our challenges. His voice is loud, his language is coarse, and his politics has a darkness that would not only stop, but reverse the march of progress toward the greater, more prosperous, more equal America we can and we must become.Elect Donald Trump and get empty promises and no plan for our country.Elect Hillary Clinton and get the biggest investment in infrastructure since World War II. Elect Hillary Clinton and raise the minimum wage across our country.Elect Hillary Clinton and reduce gun violence on our streets.Elect Hillary Clinton and make debt-free college available to everybody. We've done it in L.A. We've done it as Democrats local leaders across America's cities. Now let's do it for our entire country. You see, that's Hillary Clinton's vision Ñ a united America working together. And it's that vision that makes it possible for me to be here with you tonight.I'm just your average Mexican-American Jewish Italian. But my ancestors, faced with war and persecution, crossed oceans and rivers to come to this improbable, miraculous democracy.My grandfather, Salvador, as a baby was carried over the border in his mother's arms, during the Mexican revolution. My other grandfather, Harry, was the son of Russian Jews fleeing persecution. They and their wives, Juanita and Julia, a meatpacker and a public school teacher, made lives here.And after Pearl Harbor, one of my grandfathers answered his nation's call and manufactured uniforms for GIs.The other put that uniform on, fought for the only country he knew, crossed an ocean not knowing if he'd come home and he earned his citizenship as a result.Well, today, their grandson is the mayor of the largest city in the largest state in this union, humbled to be standing before you tonight.America works best when every strand is woven into our national fabric. Some of us make the uniforms. Some of us wear the uniforms. But each of us has a role.And that is the great work that lies ahead -- to build a nation that is stronger than the one we inherited. When we mock immigrants and the disabled, when we mock Indians and women, we mock our own history. This in a nation where Navajo code talkers, and mothers on assembly lines, and Japanese-American GIs whose families were in internment camps, won a war led by a president who couldn't walk. That is our America and that is the great work that Hillary Clinton will lead us in as the next president of the United States. [Spanish audio]We are stronger together. Thank you!",,,,
Florent Groberg,"Good evening. I'm here tonight not as a Democrat or a Republican.I'm here as a proud immigrant to this country, a proud veteran of the United States Army, and the proud recipient of our country's highest military honor.Soldiers spend years training for one moment. We don't know when it will come. We don't know what it will require. But we know that when it arrives, we will be ready.My moment came four years ago in Afghanistan.A suicide bomber approached my men. I grabbed him by the vest. I threw him as far as I could Ð because that's exactly what I was trained to do.The vest exploded. It took a part of my leg with it.I was a runner in college. But the run to that vest was the last run of my life.America lost four heroes that day: Army Command Sgt. Air Force Maj. Kevin Griffin, Army Maj. Walter David Gray, Maj. Thomas Kennedy, and USAID Foreign Service Officer Ragaei Abdelfattah.I remind you, in their memory, that your military protects you with their lives. And that our president should protect us in return.Hillary Clinton has been training for this moment for decades.In the Senate, she worked across the aisle to support wounded warriors and our families.As president, she'll reform the VA Ð not privatize it. She'll help heal the invisible wounds that lead to suicide. And as commander-in-chief, she will defeat ISIS.When Hillary's moment comes, she will be ready. Ready to serve. Ready to lead. And ready to defend those who defend you.Thank you. Go Army!",,,,
Henrietta Aivey,"My name is Henrietta Ivey. I'm a Detroit home care worker. I'm a mother of four and a proud mother of seven grandchildren. I am blessed to do work I believe in -- keeping families in their homes and caring for people in need. But even as I work my fingers to the bone, I don't always feel the support I need from the leaders I'm supposed to trust. I work two jobs at minimum wage and can barely make ends meet.I remember looking at my babies' faces when they were little and fighting back tears. Because I always taught them to dream big, but I didn't always know if I would be able to live these dreams.When I first met Hillary Clinton, we connected right away as mothers and as people who have led lives of service. Because I know she will fight to raise the minimum wage. In Michigan, we are fighting for 15! A $15 minimum wage and a union! Because no working American family should have to be forced to live in poverty!I stand with Hillary Clinton because I see myself in her, and I believe she sees herself in me. I believe her steady hand in the Oval Office will help people like me breathe easier and achieve more. That makes this election bigger than politics. For me and all home care workers across the nation and my family, this is personal. I know Hillary Clinton has our backs and we will have hers. Thank you. Go out and vote Nov. 8th. And God bless you all.",,,,
Hillary Clinton,"Thank you! Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we've had.And Chelsea, thank you. I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thanks for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world. And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago is still going strong. It's lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us. And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my Explainer-in-Chief is still on the job. I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and the friends of a lifetime. To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight. And to those of you who joined our campaign this week.  And what a remarkable week it's been.  Hillary Clinton accepts the Democratic nomination for president on climactic final night of convention ÈWe heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. And the man of Hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship.  We heard from our terrific vice president, the one-and-only Joe Biden. He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do.First Lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too. And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine Ð you're soon going to understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to Governor, and now Senator.  He'll make the whole country proud as our Vice President.  And I want to thank Bernie Sanders. Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.  You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.  And to all of your supporters here and around the country:  I want you to know, I've heard you.  Your cause is our cause. Our country needs your ideas, energy, and passion.  That's the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.  We wrote it together Ð now let's go out there and make it happen together.My friends, we've come to Philadelphia Ð the birthplace of our nation Ð because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out - and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.  When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the King. Some wanted to stick it to the king, and go their own way. The revolution hung in the balance. Then somehow they began listening to each other .  compromising .  finding common purpose.   And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.That's what made it possible to stand up to a King. That took courage. They had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.  America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us.  We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.Our country's motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one.  Will we stay true to that motto?  Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention.  He wants to divide us - from the rest of the world, and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way --  from ''Morning in America'' to  ''Midnight in America.'' He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.  Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one.And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy! We will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism. Yet we know there is a lot to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad. But just look at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values.Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that these words are associated with us.  I have to tell you, as your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, and when people hear those words Ð they hear America.So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says: ''I alone can fix it.''  Those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.  Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting? Troops on the front lines.Police officers and fire fighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem.  Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.He's forgetting every last one of us.  Americans don't say: ''I alone can fix it.'' We say: ''We'll fix it together.'' Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.    Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.  20 years ago I wrote a book called ''It Takes a Village.''  A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that?   This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.     America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That's why ''Stronger Together'' is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign.It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.  A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong.  communities are safe.   And yes, love trumps hate. That's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward.   And so it is with humility, determination, and boundless confidence in America's promise.  that I accept your nomination for President of the United States!Now, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your First Lady. Served 8 years as a Senator from the great State of New York.Then I represented all of you as Secretary of State.But my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why.The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ''service'' part has always come easier to me than the ''public'' part.I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you.The family I'm from,  well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are.They used whatever tools they had Ð whatever God gave them Ð and whatever life in America provided Ð and built better lives and better futures for their kids.My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right.Watch President Obama's DNC speech ÈMy dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.  When the war was over he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.  I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.   He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had.  And he did.My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl.  She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.  She was saved by the kindness of others.  Her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share.  The lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me:  No one gets through life alone.  We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.  She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith: ''Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.'' I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school Ð it just didn't seem possible. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she went through as a child.  It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.   It's a big idea, isn't it?  Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.   But how do you make an idea like that real?  You do it step-by-step, year-by-year.  sometimes even door-by-door.   And my heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who Ð because of those changes to our laws Ð are able to get an education.It's true -- I sweat the details of policy Ð whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.   Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid - if it's your family. It's a big deal.  And it should be a big deal to your president.   Over the last three days, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.    People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.  I first met Ryan as a 7-year-old. He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed forty pounds because I leaned over to lift him up.  Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed. and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year.   Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero. I was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others ten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.  In this campaign, I've met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.  And you heard, you heard from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For the struggling, the striving and the successful. For those who vote for me and those who don't. For all Americans. Together.Tonight, we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union:  the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for President.   Standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.   Happy for boys and men, too Ð because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone.  When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.  So let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves. Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead. Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead. Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.   Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office.  Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. That's real progress.But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from so many of you who feel like the economy just isn't working.Some of you are frustrated Ð even furious. And you know what??? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should.Americans are willing to work Ð and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period.Democrats are the party of working people. But we haven't done a good enough job showing that we get what you're going through, and that we're going to do something about it.So I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States -- From my first day in office to my last! Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And if necessary we'll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together - and it's the right thing to do.Whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.  If you believe that companies should share profits, not pad executive bonuses, join us.  If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage.  and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty.  join us.If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care. join us. If you believe that we should say ''no'' to unfair trade deals -- that we should stand up to China -- that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers. join us.  If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.  join us.  And yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay.  join us --  Let's make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.Now, you didn't hear any of this from Donald Trump at his convention.   He spoke for 70-odd minutes Ð and I do mean odd.  And he offered zero solutions.But we already know he doesn't believe these things.  No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.In my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.  Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!   We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs. And here's something we don't say often enough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job. We're going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.  We're going to give small businesses a boost.  Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.  We're going to help you balance family and work.  And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ''woman card,'' then Deal Me In!Now, here's the thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90% of the gains have gone to the top 1%, that's where the money is. And we are going to follow the money. And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs .  creating jobs here at home!Now I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done?  How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?Look at my record.  I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people.  And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as President.But Trump, he's a businessman.  He must know something about the economy. Well, let's take a closer look.  In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you'll find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills. Now remember what the President said last night -- don't boo, vote.People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it Ð not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them. That sales pitch he's making to be your president? Put your faith in him Ð and you'll win big?  That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses.Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again Ð well, he could start by actually making things in America again.The choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security. Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.From Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated. No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership. You want a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it will be my highest priority.I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot Ð now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security.I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement Ð now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake Ð we will prevail.    Now Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ''I know more about ISIS than the generals do. .''No, Donald, you don't. He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ''a disaster.''Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a Senator on the Armed Services Committee. I know how wrong he is.Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces. Decisions about war and peace. Life and death.A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country Ð including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.Ask yourself:  Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief?  Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.  He loses his cool at the slightest provocation.  When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter.  When he's challenged in a debate.  When he sees a protestor at a rally.  Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started Ð not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men Ð the ones moved by fear and pride.America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. That's the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be.  And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a President who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.  I'm not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. We should be working with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.    For decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics were too hot to touch. But I ask you: how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence. You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals. I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more. That starts with listening to each other. Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.  So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will defend all our rights Ð civil rights, human rights and voting rights.  women's rights and workers' rights.  LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities! And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments Ð excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They think he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says Ð like when he called women ''pigs.''Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.  Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain Ða true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.At first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom Ð that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.   But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it. And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great Ð because America is good.  So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change. He's offering empty promises. What are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country - to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve. The choice is clear, my friends.Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone.     I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together again. But I'm here to tell you tonight Ð progress is possible.  I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up. And I know it from my own life.More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game. Like so much else, I got this from my mother.  She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. ''Go back out there,'' she said. And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.  We lost our mother a few years ago but I miss her every day.  And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working and to keep fighting for right, no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation.And though ''we may not live to see the glory,'' as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ''let us gladly join the fight.'' Let our legacy be about ''planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.''That's why we're here -- not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans. Let's look to the future with courage and confidence. Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever.Thank you and may God bless you and the United States of America!",,,,
James Clyburn,"Thank you! Thank you very, very much! My Fellow Democrats, and hello, South Carolina!As a father of three daughters and grandfather of two adorable granddaughters, I'm proud to stand before you as we prepare to offer the American people an opportunity to smash through the ultimate glass ceiling in our nation by nominating for president of the United States a person who is more qualified Ñ by education and training, experience and temperament Ñ than anyone who has ever offered for the job. And when it comes to current pursuers, it ain't even close.The changes we seek for our great country will not come easy. To achieve a stronger and better America, we need a leader who is willing and able to fight for the dreams of all Americans. If there's one thing I know about Hillary Clinton it is this: She is a fighter. And she fights with her head and her heart. In my home state of South Carolina, we often say, ''you can best tell what a person will do by looking at what he or she has done.'' When she graduated from law school, Hillary Clinton came to South Carolina to help reform our juvenile justice system and traveled across the region to help make the 1965 Voting Rights Act real in the lives of all Americans.In Arkansas, she fought to reform education. As First Lady, she fought for universal health care and succeeded in helping secure the Children's Health Insurance Program that provides health care for millions of children and laid the groundwork for the Affordable Care Act.As a Senator and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton always worked to advance our nation's ''pursuit of a more perfect union.'' Hillary Clinton knows that we must take effective action on the issue of income inequality. She has embraced the Congressional Black Caucus's 10-20-30 plan to target federal resources into areas of persistent poverty. Hillary Clinton's first policy speech in this campaign was on criminal justice reform. She will work to get rid of mandatory minimums, mass incarcerations, and private for-profit prisons.Hillary Clinton does not fear getting outside of her comfort zone. She knows that we are stronger as a nation when we work together. She embodies our nation's motto, E Pluribus Unum, out of many one.John F. Kennedy challenged us to reach for the moon, and we did. Lyndon Baines Johnson courageously tackled poverty and inequality in America and his achievements continue to lift our communities and sustain our citizens. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. pointed us to the mountaintop, and although we are not there yet, we are still climbing. And with President Hillary Clinton, America will rise even further._My standing before you tonight is a testament to the strength of our party, the goodness of our people, and the greatness of our nation. Our nation is strong, but we can be stronger. Americans are good, but we can be better. America is great, but it can be greater.My fellow Democrats, America's brightest days are yet to come. We have bigger and better things to achieve. But achieving bigger and better things requires working together and working harder. Let's emerge from Philadelphia working together to make our nation stronger, Americans better, and America greater by electing Hillary Rodham Clinton the next president of these United States.God bless each and every one of you and God bless these United States of America.Thank you!",,,,
Jennifer Granholm,"I actually want to speak tonight to those Americans who feel you've been left behind. The Americans who believe you've been cheated, who believe that those at the top don't care about you.Now, I know a little something about this because I was governor of Michigan Ð the epicenter of America's manufacturing rise, and its painful fall, and its resurgence. Michigan built the automobile and the automobile built America. But when the manufacturing industry fell on hard times, so did Michigan. So did many of your states. And we were angry about it Ð about jobs going to low-wage countries -- about unfair trade.But we were also determined -- determined -- to build industries of the future. We said we wanted advanced manufacturing. We wanted new jobs. So we started this hard process of moving in that direction. And then, in 2008, we elected a Democratic president for us to work with. And you know what he did? He saved the American auto industry. And then that renewed auto industry paid America back in full. And that is what we can do when we work together.I like many of you am a fierce Democrat. But I know there are Democrats and Republicans across the country who want to create jobs in America. Liberals and conservatives. Public sector and private industry. Because we're not in this alone Ð we're all in this together.One candidate gets that. And one candidate, as Joe Biden said last night, doesn't have a clue.Some people are worried. Some people are angry. I get that. But the answer is not to tear our country down, it's to build our country up. Not to build walls that keep out the rest of the world, but to keep building the industries and universities that the rest of the world wishes they could get into.   Hillary Clinton gets it. And that's why she has huge plans to create good-paying jobs in America.Imagine that -- imagine that Ð actual plans! I must have missed that night of the Republican Convention!Detailed plans, people! Written down! Plans with numbers that add up!   You wanna see them? You can actually see them! Just text JOBS to 47246.Now, last week, we heard about Trump's hopeless vision of our country. And then he said: ''I alone can fix it.''So imagine Donald Trump's version of the Constitution: ''I, the person, in order to form a more perfect union. ''Or, centuries later, ''I, shall overcome.''Or, ''Ask not what I can do for my country, ask what my country can do for me!''Donald, Donald, you're so vain. You probably think this speech is about you. Don't you now? Here's what I know: We have got to stop Donald Trump!Our great country spans a continent, but we are all connected to each other, no matter where we live.So when a miner in Virginia has the dignity of a new job in the advanced steel industry, we all have dignity.   When the engineering student in the Sunshine State builds the solar panels of the future, we all succeed.When the autoworker in Detroit builds the electric vehicle, that drives us forward. We all win. Right? Whether you're in Michigan or Maryland or Missouri or Montana.And this, too: When Flint's water poisons its children, it hurts all of us. These are our children. We are all Flint!Right, Philadelphia?Our next president knows that a nation is a village. That we are one family. And in a family, no one gets left behind. Not the steelworker in Pennsylvania! Not the farmer in Iowa! Not the DREAMer in Nevada! Not the factory worker in Ohio!As our next president says we're stronger together.We're stronger. How? Together!We're going to keep America great. How? Together!And we're going to work our hearts out to elect Hillary Clinton president. How? Together!Let's do this, brothers and sisters! Together!",,,,
Jennifer Pierottilim,"One of my first memories is standing outside our Richmond, Virginia polling place with my dad to hand out campaign literature in support of our chosen candidates -- our chosen Republican candidates.When it comes to campaigning, I have done it all -- phone banked voters and knocked on so many doors. I bet a lot of you did the same. One difference though -- I campaigned exclusively for the GOP. until this election. I've voted Republican my entire life. I believe in the bedrock values of the Republican Party: liberty, equality, and the idea that there are individual rights that cannot be taken away. These are values to be proud of.And because the Republican Party has abandoned those values this year, this Republican is voting for Hillary Clinton.In Donald Trump's America, it doesn't matter what I've accomplished as an attorney and policy expert. All that matters is how attractive I am on a scale of one to ten.Trump's loathsome comments about women and our appearances are too many to list and too crass to repeat. They are too important to ignore though.Trump can discount our accomplishments, he can disrespect our abilities, but come November he cannot disregard our votes!There are some who will say I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a woman. People who say that dismiss my voice and Hillary's long record of public service.And I know there are some who are contemplating staying home this November. Your voice can help define the next chapter of American values, American policy, and American leadership around the world Ð for better or for worse.I'm here tonight to ask all of you to join me to not only oppose Donald Trump, but to support Hillary Clinton because we're not just Republicans and Democrats, we're Americans.",,,,
Joaquin Castro,"In 1922, the only grandparent that I would ever know came to the United States from Mexico. She wasn't a rapist or a murderer. She was a six-year-old orphan. But as a girl, she walked past storefront signs that read ''No Dogs or Mexicans Allowed.'' Her life wasn't easy. And she didn't always feel welcomed. But she never stopped believing in America's sacred promise that her sacrifices would be rewarded with opportunity for herself and her family. She kept up her part of the promise by working her whole life: babysitting, cooking, and cleaning houses.And the fact that her grandson is standing here on this stage tonight is proof that America kept its promise, too.Four years ago my brother, Julin, stood on this stage in Charlotte. He and I know that our story is not unique. This room is filled with proud Americans who can tell similar stories about their own families. Great-grandchildren of Irish immigrants who came to cities like New York and Boston and saw signs that read ''No Irish Need Apply'' and just worked harder. Grandchildren of Americans who suffered in World War II internment camps Ñ the same camps that Donald Trump has defended Ñ and grew up to be business owners, war heroes, and public servants. Children of immigrants who have contributed to our country as doctors, police officers, and Ñ guess what Ñ even impartial judges.Their story is our story. It's America's story. And make no mistake: The hero of that story is never the one who sides with hate. The hero of that story will never be Donald Trump. Americans know that the choices he offers are false ones.See, in America, prosperity is not a zero-sum game. We can create millions of new jobs and still raise the minimum wage. National security is not a zero-sum game. We can keep America safe and still welcome the next generation of immigrants without a religious litmus test. Justice is not a zero-sum game. We can back our brave men and women in blue and still believe that Black Lives Matter. These aren't zero-sum games. In fact, they aren't games at all.But do you know how many plans Donald Trump has to accomplish these things? Zero!While Donald Trump is talking about building walls, Hillary Clinton is working to build an infrastructure of opportunity Ñ a way for Americans to get to  where they want to go in life: great schools to prepare us for college and career, a strong health care system. And I don't care what Donald Trump or Ted Cruz or anybody else says, the Affordable Care Act is here to stay because it saved millions of American lives. And an economy where no one who works full time and works hard lives in poverty.Republicans would have you believe that creating opportunity means giving tax breaks to corporations and the super wealthy. Well, I've met a lot of Americans in my life. And no one of them has ever told me that their ancestors came to this country looking for the lowest corporate tax rate.The promise of America is much bigger than that. And there's room in it -- there's room here -- for everyone. Donald Trump isn't going to keep that promise. He's not even going to try. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will.That's why I'm asking all of you to go to ''IWillVote.com.'' Make sure you're registered to vote. Make sure the next chapter of our great American story is written by us!My grandmother believed that America was the greatest nation in the world.And I'm with Hillary so that our grandkids will believe the same thing too.",,,,
John Allen,"My fellow Americans, I stand with you tonight as a retired four-star general of the United States Marine Corps, and I am joined by my fellow generals and admirals, and with these magnificent young veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. They went there and they risked their lives because they love this country. They are here before you because this is the most consequential election is the greatest one in our memory for the president of the United States.The stakes are enormous. We must not, we could not stand on the sidelines. This election can carry us to a future of unity and hope or to a dark place of discord and fear. We must choose hope.Every American in uniform, in the White House or at home -- USA! USA! USA! -- we must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us. All of us. Every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, including the Americans who are our precious Muslims. And every gender and every gender orientation. All of us together -- all of us together -- pursuing our common values.My fellow Americans, from the battlefield to the capitals of our allies and friends and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humankind, for we are the greatest country on this planet.So we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for president of the United States of America.We trust her judgment. We trust in her judgment. We believe in her vision for a united America. We believe in her vision of America as the just and strong leader against the forces of hatred, the forces of chaos and darkness. We know that she Ð as no other Ð knows how to use all instruments of American power, not just the military, to keep us all safe and free.My fellow Americans, I tell you without any hesitation or reservation that Hillary Clinton will be exactly -- exactly -- the kind of commander-in-chief America needs. I know this because I served with her. I know this as the former Special Presidential Envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS.With her as our commander-in-chief, America will continue to lead in this volatile world. We will oppose and resist tyranny as we will defeat evil. America will defeat ISIS and protect the homeland. America will honor our treaty obligations. We will lead and strengthen NATO and the Atlantic Alliance, and our allies in East Asia and around the world whom we have sworn a solemn oath to defend. My fellow Americans, we will stop the spread of nuclear weapons and keep them from the hands of dangerous states and groups. Our armed forces will be stronger. They will have the finest weapons, the greatest equipment. They will have the support of the American people -- you -- and the American military will continue to be the shining example of America at our very best. Our veterans will be thanked by a grateful nation, and they will be cared for in the manner they deserve for the sacrifices they have made for all of us, for this great country, and for world peace.But I also know that with her as our commander-in-chief, our international relations will not be reduced to a business transaction.I also know our armed forces will not become an instrument of torture, and they will not be ordered to engage in murder or carry out other illegal activities.With Hillary Clinton as our commander-in-chief, the United States will continue to be that indispensable, transformational power in the world.To our allies and our friends and our partners. Listen closely. We are with you. America will not abandon you. To those acting against peace, civilization and the world order: We will oppose you. And to our enemies -- to our enemies -- we will pursue you as only America can. You will fear us. And to ISIS and others: We will defeat you.Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, my fellow veterans, this is the moment. This is the opportunity for our future and that of the world. We must seize this moment to elect Hillary Clinton as president of the United States of America!Thank you! And God bless you and God bless America!",,,,
John Hickenlooper,"Thirty years ago, almost to the day, I lost my job. Now, whether it's being laid off, downsized, or fired, it's not funny, and it's not a reality show punchline when it happens to you. And it wasn't just me, a whole generation of geologists lost their careers in that recession. It is hard when you feel you aren't wanted anymore.After many months, with hardly an interview, a buddy and I decided to start the first brewpub in Colorado. We had no money. Even my own mother wouldn't invest. Finally, 18 months later, we opened in an abandoned warehouse district in downtown Denver. We got 34 small investors, two bank loans, a loan from the city, and a loan from the SBA. But we openedAnd slowly but surely, we grew, and thrived, and expanded.Now I've never hosted a reality TV show, but I know that the true mark of a successful businessman is not the number of times you say, ''You're fired''. It's the number of times you say, ''You're hired.'' That's right, I'm a business guy. But unlike Trump's businesses, my business didn't go bankrupt six times.Now, one thing I've learned is that success is sweeter when it's shared, and that's just as true in business as it is in life.In our neighborhood, there were a handful of other entrepreneurs trying to develop lofts or start businesses. Together, we worked with the Downtown Denver Partnership, the tourism board, and the city to create a sense of place. More entrepreneurs arrived to start more businesses. And the neighborhood took off, and so did Denver.Sure, it was my buddy and I that took the risk. But as Hillary Clinton says, ''It takes a village'' Ð businesses, government, non-profits Ð working together to create opportunity. She understands that even in Colorado, land of ''rugged individualism,'' our economy is stronger together.As a small businessman, then mayor of Denver, and now governor, I've seen how partnerships drive economies. Today, Denver is the fastest-growing big city in America, and Colorado has the second strongest economy in the country. Now, compare that to Donald Trump's trickle-down economics Ð where he doesn't pay his bills and small businesses go out of business.I've spent time with Hillary and I can tell you, from a small business perspective, she gets it. Tremendous changes in our economy are making people feel that they aren't wanted anymore. And I remember that feeling. Many of the skills that would have been tickets to the middle class are no longer needed. That's why we discussed not only the importance of education and training, but streamlining regulations, expanding access to loans, incentivizing innovation, and how to support the transformation of new ideas into new jobs. I told her about Colorado's new apprenticeship initiative that allows kids to both work, and take classes that help them to be more successful in their jobs.And Hillary Clinton understands that, especially in these economic times, partnerships can lead to opportunity, which is why she wants to offer tax incentives to companies that offer apprenticeships in underserved areas.Now, she's going to make the largest investment in jobs since World War II. And she'll cut red tape and taxes so it's easier to start and grow a small business. Hillary Clinton is going to work for the young entrepreneur who wants to open a brewpub, or launch a start-up, or even create a drapery business, just like her dad, Hugh Rodham, did all those years ago in Chicago.Now, tonight, Hillary Clinton accepts the nomination for president of the United States of America. And tomorrow, we're going to get down to business.So I say to you, put down your Pokemon Go for just a second and go to HillaryClinton.com. If you sign up before midnight, you could have a chance to win an opportunity to be with her on the campaign trail. We all have a job to do: electing Hillary Clinton. So let's go to work!God bless you!",,,,
Joyce Beatty,"Good evening, fellow Democrats! I'm thrilled to see so many people from the great state of Ohio here tonight.It is an honor to be here on this historic evening, when we move one step closer to electing the 45th president of these United States of America. Yes, united not divided. I emphasize ''united'' because Ñ like Hillary Clinton Ñ I know that we are stronger together.This election to me is about choosing between two fundamentally different visions of America, and I believe the choice is crystal clear.Hillary Clinton is by far the most experienced, qualified, and skilled candidate. She cares deeply about each and every American, no matter what you look like, where you are from, or who you love.Donald Trump, on the other hand, is the most divisive and ill-prepared candidate we've seen in modern times Ñ looking to wind back the clock on all the progress we have made as a nation together. He has built a career on intimidation, discrimination, and bullying Ñ at the expense of and on the backs of small businesses and hardworking families.In contrast, Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to lifting up hardworking families, women, and small businesses. I want you and all Americans to know the Hillary Clinton that I know. The Hillary who sits with me and talks about her grandchildren, Charlotte and Aidan, and my grandchildren, Leah and Spencer.The Hillary who sees unlimited potential in every child.The Hillary who fights for civil rights and freedom for all.The Hillary who will fight for the hope of a brighter future, a more inclusive America, and greater global peace and cooperation.Americans want a commander-in-chief, not a divider-in-chief.I know which one I choose, and that is the future 45th president of the United States of America, my good friend, Hillary Clinton!I'm with her because she's with us!I am Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, and I approve this message. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.Love you, Ohio!",,,,
Kareen Abdul Abbar,"Hello, everyone. I'm Michael Jordan and I'm here with Hillary!I said that because I know that Donald Trump couldn't tell the difference. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and I'm here to tell you about Captain Humayun Khan, who was one of 14 American Muslim soldiers who have died in combat serving the United States since 9/11. His family immigrated to the United States from the United Arab Emirates, where Capt. Khan was born.The first place they visited upon arriving in America was the Jefferson Memorial.The words engraved there read: ''I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.''Donald Trump's idea to register Muslims and prevent them from entering our country is the very tyranny Jefferson abhorred.In 1777, Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which later became a model for the First Amendment. Today's so-called ''religious freedom'' acts, like the one signed by Gov. Mike Pence in Indiana, they are the opposite of what Jefferson wanted because they allow discrimination.And at its core, discrimination is the result of fear. Those who think Americans scare easily enough to abandon our country's ideals in exchange for a false sense of security underestimate our resolve. To them we say only this: Not here! Not ever!Thank you!",,,,
Katie McGinty,"Hello, and thank you for joining us in Philadelphia Ñ the City of Brotherly and Sisterly Love!I am running for United States Senate here in Pennsylvania. And I know that, during these last few days, you've seen that Pennsylvania is great -- and it is great -- for the same reasons America is great -- hard work, timeless values, and the belief that we each must look out for each other.I was raised here in Philadelphia, the ninth of 10 kids in a big, loud Irish family. My grandparents were Irish immigrants. Now, my parents didn't have college degrees. My dad walked the beat as a police officer.  And mom, well, she worked as a restaurant hostess. But when we were growing up, none of that mattered. You see, we learned to love our God and our country. We learned that success is not a product of pedigree. No, if you want to succeed, you just have to give it your all, everyday, and then be willing to give back.For my brothers and sisters and me, this was the deal. But for so many families, that deal is off the table. Why? Because, today, middle-class families aren't making a dime more in real terms than they were two decades ago. But we know costs have been going through the roof.Here are the facts: We have the most productive economy in the world. But the benefits of that productivity all go to the top. Top executives used to make 30 times the average guy or gal. Now it's over 300 times. That's wrong for our families and that is wrong for America.The truth is that fear and anxiety do reach far and wide across this great country. Hard-working people are feeling anxious and insecure. But we have a choice. Our choice is how do we respond. It's this choice that's on the ballot in November.Now, we could respond with more scapegoating and fear-mongering. That's the tack of Donald Trump and my opponent, Pat Toomey. Blame the Mexicans. Blame the Muslims. Blame the government. Build a wall. For goodness sakes, the Donald even blamed the pope! My dear mother, God rest her soul, would be turning over in her grave on that one!And you know what these guys also say: ''Hand it all over to Wall Street.'' Pat Toomey made his millions on Wall Street. And he's still trying to sell us the same old trickle-down. We're not buying it. We know that trickle-down only benefits those who are already on the top. Trust the stock market with your hard-earned Social Security, Pat Toomey says. Trust the wheelers and dealers with your savings, and you will be living large.But you know what? We've seen this bad movie and all of its sequels many times before. The ending is always the same: Things work out for the big shots, and everyone else -- the average Joe, the average Jane, everyone else -- gets stiffed with the bill!Now, we also have a different choice. We can work together. We can expand opportunity. We can respect every single person in this country. We can build on the strength of our diversity, and the diversity of our strengths.You know, my brothers are heavy equipment operators, a printer, an X-ray certified welder. And we know a great country doesn't just buy and consume stuff. A great country makes and builds stuff. And so as Democrats, we can Ñ and we must and we will Ñ work for good schools, and affordable college, and job-training that enables our families and our neighbors to make and build the economy of tomorrow.This is the American way: Work hard, get ahead. This is what I will fight for in the United States Senate, and this is what Hillary Clinton will fight for and deliver for us in the White House.Thank you and God bless America!",,,,
Khizr Khan,"First, our thoughts and prayers are with our veterans and those who serve today. Tonight, we are honored to stand here as the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country.Like many immigrants, we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy Ñ that with hard work and the goodness of this country, we could share in and contribute to its blessings.We were blessed to raise our three sons in a nation where they were free to be themselves and follow their dreams.Our son, Humayun, had dreams too of being a military lawyer. But he put those dreams aside the day he sacrificed his life to save his fellow soldiers.Hillary Clinton was right when she called my son ''the best of America.''If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America.Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities, women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us from this country.Donald Trump, you're asking Americans to trust you with our future. Let me ask you: Have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words ''liberty'' and ''equal protection of law.''Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of the brave patriots who died defending United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities.You have sacrificed nothing and no one.We cannot solve our problems by building walls and sowing division.We are stronger together.And we will keep getting stronger when Hillary Clinton becomes our president.In conclusion, I ask every patriot American, all Muslim immigrants, and all immigrants to not take this election lightly. This is a historic election and I request to honor the sacrifice of my son. And on election day, take the time to get out and vote and vote for the healer, vote for the strongest, most qualified candidate, Hillary Clinton -- not the divider. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you.",,,,
Lupe Valdez,"Good evening! I am the youngest of eight children born to migrant workers. When I told my father that I was going to join the police, he got angry. You see, he and my older brothers had been beaten by the police for no legitimate reason. But I stuck with my decision. Years later, whenever I visited, he'd show my badge off to all his friends. He saw the good I was doing in my job, and he was proud of me.And I am proud of my fellow officers. When my officers report for duty, they have no idea what might come up that day.  When they respond to a domestic violence call, they don't know whether a victim or an abuser with a gun will meet them at the door. When they stop a vehicle, they have no idea whether the driver is racing to the hospital to deliver a baby or fleeing the scene of crime. They don't know whether the next 9-1-1 call will be their last. But they keep answering the call. They keep putting their lives on the line. They are doing the best they can to protect our communities. We put on our badges every day to serve and protect, not to hate and discriminate.  We lost five officers in Dallas. They were gunned down as they were protecting citizens protesting the police. It's been a tough time for law enforcement communities all across America who have lost officers to violence. I've been trying to make some kind of sense out of it. But violence is not the answer. Yelling, screaming, and calling each other names is not going to do it. Talking within our own group in your language only our group understands leads nowhere. We have to start listening to each other.My deputies have worked hard to reach out to the communities we serve. We attend all sorts of events: Ramadan, Cinco de Mayo, Juneteenth, Pride, veterans' parades, Irish festivals. You name it. We show up. And some of our officers are uncomfortable at first. But the only way to serve your community is to know your community.Last Sunday, after working in the morning, I went in uniform to meet my partner for lunch at a nice restaurant. As I handed the server my credit card, he smiled and said that at least four tables had already offered to pay for our meal. My girlfriend and I both teared up. There wasn't a single person in that restaurant that I personally knew. The people of Dallas know that even though our men and women in uniform were hurting, we never stop doing the job.  Please help me in honor all of America's fallen officers with a moment of silence.Shouts of ''Black Lives Matter'' from audience members]",,,,
Nancy Pelosi,"Good evening. It is my honor to stand before you tonight as a proud member of the progressive California delegation and to acknowledge my D'Alesandro, Maryland roots. It is a privilege to stand before you as the Leader of the House Democrats Ð a caucus honored to serve with our partner Senate Leader Harry Reid and our friend Vice President Joe Biden and with one of the greatest presidents in our history, President Barack Obama! Together we passed the Affordable Care Act. Together we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Act, the Reinvestment and Recovery Act, Dodd-Frank Act. We repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. None of this would have been possible without the courage of our House Democrats. We are a caucus proud that we look like 21st-century America -- over 50% women, people of color, and LGBT community members. What a contrast to the restricted club that met in convention in Cleveland last week. Our convention is different, and so is our mission.We come to public service and to this convention not to trumpet darkness, but to fight a way forward for our country -- a bright light forward. We come here comforted that we are approaching a milestone in our nation's history -- the election of the first woman president of the United States.Hillary Clinton knows that this moment is not just about one woman's achievement. It's about what electing a woman president will mean for achieving the dreams and hopes and aspirations of every woman, every daughter, every son, and every family, all across our land, for generations to come.This moment is about the landmark progress President Hillary Clinton will achieve for families everywhere yearning for a better life, a better chance, in a better America. Hillary Clinton has a vision rooted in deeply held values. She has a genuine strength that contrasts profoundly from her opponent's bluster. She has a gift for strategic thinking, from her knowledge and her experience. And she has a connection to hard-working American families forged in her lifetime of leadership and service to others.Leadership and public service are our cause and our calling as Democrats.Here is our commitment to the American people for a stronger America. First, secure our nation with strong action to keep Americans safe, fighting terror at home and abroad, and eliminating ISIS. We must be strong and smart, not reckless and rash.At home, safer communities demand courage, not cowardice, in the face of the National Rifle Association. For the sake of the 91 Americans who are killed by gun violence each day, we must break the grip of the gun lobby on Congress and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. If you're on the no-fly list, then you belong on the no-buy list. That is why Democrats, led by a national icon, our Congressman John Lewis, held our historic 26-hour sit-in in the Capitol. And we won't stop until Congress heeds the will of the American people and disarms hate.Secondly to make America stronger, we must secure our future Ð our economic future -- by investing in education, innovation, and opportunity. Our imperative is to create more good jobs and a living wage, with equal pay for equal work and paid leave for everyone, so that every family can earn their dreams Ð buy a home, send their children to college, retire with dignity Ð and never have to worry that their Social Security will be privatized or Medicare's guarantee will be taken away. And our imperative is quality health care that builds on the Affordable Care Act Ð which now covers 20 million more Americans.Third, for a stronger America, we must secure our democracy by removing barriers to voting and draining the poisonous swamp of secret money in politics. We Democrats believe that the future of America should be decided by the voices of the voters, not the pocketbooks of the powerful.Not far from here, our founders pledged their lives, their liberty, and their sacred honor to create a democracy. A government of the many, not a government of the money. So Hillary Clinton and House Democrats and Senate Democrats are sworn to free our democracy by overturning Citizens United. Then Ð and only then Ð can we make America truly fair.And only then can we have fairness in a budget that should be a statement of our values, that invests in the future, creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and ensures that everyone is paying their fair share for an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.We know what is on the line in what truly is the most important election of our lifetime. Has anybody ever said that to you before -- the most important election of our lifetime? They just keep getting more important. For the future of the Supreme Court, for the fate of a planet imperiled by climate change, for the sake of immigration reform, for the promise of an America that rewards hard work rather than rewarding those who exploit America's workers, for women's reproductive rights, equal rights, civil rights, and to do what is right for our service members, veterans and military families who have given so much for our country, we will stand and speak and campaign for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.And I tell you this: They will win in November. We will fight to restore Democratic majorities in the Senate and in the House. And I tell you this: We can do it.Are you ready to work for a great Democratic victory in November? Are you ready to make history by electing Hillary Clinton president of the United States? I thought so. Onward to victory!God bless you. God bless our men and women in uniform. God bless America.Thank you all very much! Onward to victory. Thank you.",,,,
Patrick Maloney,"Good evening!My name is Sean Patrick Maloney. I am the first openly gay person ever elected to Congress from the state of New York -- the great state of New York. You know, last week, a speaker at the Republican convention called equality a -- quote -- ''distraction.'' ''Who cares?'' he asked. Well, I care. My husband Randy and our three children care. These LGBT leaders standing with me and throughout this hall and the country care. The authors of our nation's Declaration of Independence, signed right here in Philadelphia, they cared. Americans at Seneca Falls, Selma, and Stonewall Ð they cared. And Hillary Clinton cares, too.You know, I want to tell you a story. On June 26, 2015, I was walking to work past the Supreme Court. A crowd was gathered, awaiting the Court's historic marriage decision. The news hit like a thunderclap. A lot of us wept. Then, spontaneously, hundreds joined together to sing our national anthem. I called Randy. I could barely speak. You see, Randy and I have been together for 24 years -- I love you, honey -- 23 of those years we've been raising children.You know, yes, our family is different, but we read bedtime stories the same. We tie shoes and check homework the same. We dream and we comfort the same. But until that day, we weren't the same, not really, not in the eyes of the law. So, as I listened to our national anthem, I realized that our family, our love was no longer less than. We were now equal.You know, it's a beautiful thing when your country catches up to you. And when your basic rights and your very family are on the line, it matters what happens in those beautiful buildings with marble columns. It matters who's leading our country, and it matters if they care.America, we have a choice. Donald Trump doesn't care about some families. He's against marriage equality. He wants to go back. You know, when I first met Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire 24 years ago, I was a nobody. I was a nobody. I was some gay kid sleeping on a couch. I was scared to death that who I was wasn't going to be okay. It would mean that I would not be able to be who I was and that no one would ever care about me. And here was this woman, this incredible woman, who was about to become our First Lady and she cared. And over the last 24 years she's kept right on caring about me, about my husband, about our kids, and she has seen us, really seen us. And I've seen the way my kids look at her, knowing that she cares about our family, that she cares about your family, that she cares about all families. And that's why we must care about this election.Now, I want to introduce Sarah McBride. Sarah McBride is a courageous young leader, and she is right now the first trans person ever to address a national convention. It's about time. Sarah, it is an honor to make history with you, because we are stronger together.",,,,
Sarah McBride,"My name is Sarah McBride, and I am a proud transgender American. Four years ago, I came out as transgender while serving as student body president in college. At the time, I was scared. I worried that my dreams and my identity were mutually exclusive. Since then though, I've seen that change is possible. I witnessed history interning at the White House and helping my home state of Delaware pass protections for transgender people. Today, I see this change in the work of the LGBT Caucus and in my own job at the Human Rights Campaign. But despite our progress, so much work remains. Will we be a nation where there's only one way to love, only one way to look, and only one way to live? Or will we be a nation where everyone has the freedom to live openly and equally? A nation that's stronger together? That is the question in this election. For me, this struggle for equality became all the more urgent when I learned that my future husband Andrew was battling cancer. I met Andy, who was a transgender man, fighting for equality and we fell in love. And yet even in the face of his terminal illness, this 28-year-old he never wavered in his commitment to our cause and his belief that this country can change. Andy and I married in 2014. And just four days after our wedding, he passed away. Knowing Andy left me profoundly changed. But more than anything else, his passing taught me that everyday matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest. Hillary Clinton understands the urgency of our fight. She'll work with us to pass the Equality Act to combat violence against transgender women of color and to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic once and for all. Today in America, LGBTQ people are still targeted hate that lives in both laws and in hearts. Many struggle just to get by. But I believe that tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow we can be respected and protected, especially if Hillary Clinton is our president. And that's why I'm proud to stand here and say that I'm with her. Thank you all very much.",,,,
Sherrod Brown,"It's an honor to be in the birthplace of our democracy this evening.I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. My dad was the town doctor. I never saw him turn a patient away. He didn't see profit margins; he saw people who needed help. My mother, who grew up in Mansfield, Georgia, raised three Eagle Scouts. She taught each of us to fight for justice. My wife, Connie, grew up in Ashtabula, Ohio. Her father worked at the electric plant. He was a proud member of Utility Workers Local 270. Her mother was a nurse's aide and hospice home care worker. They wore their bodies out working long days so their children could go to college.For too many Americans today, that same hard work is not paying off. People work longer hours, they produce more. But while corporate profits have gone up, workers' wages haven't kept pace.Hillary Clinton knows that a job is not just a paycheck. It's about building a better life for your family. She's a progressive who gets things done. And she has a real plan to give American workers the chance to share in the profits they create.Now, Donald Trump believes ''wages are too high'' Ð those are his words. Too high? And he wants to be president? How do you help Americans build better lives for their families when you outsource jobs? This suit I'm wearing? Made by union workers 10 miles from my Cleveland home in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump suits? Made in Mexico. Trump glassware? Made in Europe Ð not Toledo, America's glass city. Trump furniture? Made in Turkey, not Archbold, Ohio. Donald Trump's hat may be stamped with ''Make America Great Again,'' but his ties are stamped ''Made in China.''Now, I've been fighting for a trade agenda for more than 20 years that puts American workers first. And I can tell you, in all those years, I've never ever even seen Donald Trump. No Ð the only thing I've seen Donald Trump do when it comes to U.S. trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets. While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America.$10 billion in ''Made in America'' tax credits to revitalize manufacturing.Now, Trump proposes tax cuts, too -- $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can't say for sure how much Trump will take for himself because he's refused to share his tax returns with the American people.But the one thing we know for sure is, Donald Trump looks out only for Donald Trump, no matter who he steps on along the way. Now, just ask the Friel family. They had a cabinetmaking business based right here in Philadelphia Ð that is, until they signed a contract with Trump Plaza. They finished their work, but Trump refused to pay them what they were owed, starting a downward spiral that ended in bankruptcy.Five decades. They'd spent nearly five decades in business, providing jobs and livelihoods to workers and families and community. And it all came crashing down after a contract with Donald Trump.Now, Trump says he wants to run our country like one of his businesses. I guess that means he wants to slap his name on it, make false promises, and then scam innocent people out of their savings.Look, there's no question we have work to do. We face serious challenges today. Too many families struggle just to get by, let alone to get a little bit ahead. Donald Trump thinks people in states like mine will choose his counterfeit campaign over the genuine solutions we're fighting for tonight. He is wrong. Donald Trump looks at towns in the middle of America and he sees a ''rust belt'' of decay.Well, we reject that term ''rust belt.'' Hillary, my friend Tim Kaine, and I see vibrant and innovative communities throughout the industrial heartland. Cleveland is pioneering the country's first freshwater wind farm in Lake . Youngstown is leading the way in advanced manufacturing. And that power plant where Connie's father worked in Ashtabula? It isn't rusting. It's been converted to a water processing plant, supporting hundreds and hundreds of Ohio jobs. That's how we rebuild a thriving American middle class.Those are the kinds of solutions Hillary Clinton will deliver, solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. And that's why Hillary will win Ohio because as everyone in this great hall knows, as Ohio goes, so goes the nation.Now, in this hall on Tuesday, Connie and I were overtaken with emotion when our longtime friend Bernie Sanders moved to nominate Hillary Clinton to lead our party to victory. It took me back to Mansfield, Ohio, when I was a third grader at Brinkerhoff Elementary School. I remember looking up at the poster on the wall of our American Presidents. Other than a few mustaches and powdered wigs, they all looked pretty much like me.My two granddaughters and my three grandsons are too young -- they're too young -- to appreciate the historic nature of this moment. But when they go to school and they look up at those same presidential posters in their classrooms, they won't see faces that look only like mine. They will see Barack Obama. And because of the work we do over the next hundred days, my granddaughters will see themselves in the face of President Hillary Rodham Clinton!Thank you!",,,,
Tammy Duckworth,"Twelve years ago, I was copiloting a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq. A rocket-propelled grenade ripped through our cockpit, and I am only here tonight because of the miracles that followed. Some I can explain, like the bravery of my crew, determined not to leave me behind. Some I can't, like the shrapnel from the explosion passing through the spinning rotor blades without destroying them, allowing us to land.What I do know is that I started that day doing what I loved. I ended it knocked down. Surviving only because my buddies refused to leave me and wouldn't stop, even as they struggled to carry my body, with its missing limbs. Eleven days later, I woke up with a debt I can never repay. And I still wake up every morning trying to be worthy of them and their struggle, of this miraculous second chance.My family and I had been knocked down before. My dad, a proud Marine, lost his job in his 50s. For a little time, Dad did odd jobs. My mom took in sewing. I got a minimum-wage job. We relied on food stamps to help us get by. The summer before I started college, my parents walked everywhere instead of taking the bus. Once a week, they would hand over that saved up bus money $10 to the university housing office, a deposit so I could move into the dorms in the fall.Thanks to Pell Grants, work study, affordable student loans, and lots of waitressing, I fulfilled my dream of college. I worked hard, but I had a lot of help from my community and my country. And my story is not unique.It's a story about why this is the greatest nation on earth -- a nation that so many are willing to die defending. A nation that says if you keep working hard, we won't abandon you.Of course, in Donald Trump's America, if you get knocked down, you stay down. By the way, Donald Trump, I didn't put my life on the line to defend our democracy so you could invite Russia to interfere in it. You are not fit to be the commander-in-chief.My fellow Americans, we can choose a different path.Ten years after my helicopter was shot down, almost to the day, I got my most important job: I became a mom. And we named our little girl after Abigail Adams, who urged her husband to ''remember the ladies'' as he and his colleagues first declared our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness Ñ just a few miles from this very spot.My Abigail already knows that women can fly helicopters in combat. And in 102 days, when we elect Hillary, my daughter's first memories of a president will be of a woman.Democrats, tonight, let's go forward with confidence and pride in who we are and what we believe. We're Democrats because we stand up for the most vulnerable among us. We embrace the notion that lifting one another up doesn't cost nearly as much as leaving other Americans behind. We stand up for immigrants and people with disabilities. And we defend the basic values that have made, and will keep, America the greatest country in the world.May God bless each and every one of you. May God bless our troops. And always may God bless the United States of America.",,,,
Ted Lieu,"Good evening. I wasn't born in America, but I serve this great country every day. As a Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves, as a member of Congress, and as an immigrant whose parents chose this great nation, I care deeply about who serves as our commander-in-chief.And I can't wait until January 20th when that person is Hillary Clinton.But you don't have to serve in Congress or serve in the military to demand that the person we entrust with the safety of our country, the lives of our troops, and the launch codes for our nuclear weapons has a steady hand.All you have to be is a voter.You know, the scariest part of Donald Trump's acceptance speech wasn't the apocalyptic America that he believes he sees. It's that he said, ''I alone can fix it.''Every military commander I've ever met knows that you can't do it alone, you can't be brash, and you can't make stuff up. Because when you ignore facts, people will die.Hillary Clinton knows that each of us and all of our elements of national power make us stronger.Smart diplomacy. A powerful economy. Educated children.We are stronger together.You know, Donald Trump said Ð and I am not making this up Ð ''I know more about ISIS than the generals do.''Well, please welcome to this stage the four star general who knows more about ISIS than anyone, the president's former Special Envoy to the Global Coalition Against ISIS, retired Gen.

Tim Ryan,"I'm from Niles, Ohio, an old manufacturing town in the steel belt halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. When our largest steel plant closed on September 19, 1977, 5,000 workers lost their jobs overnight. Over the next decade, 40,000 more lost theirs. Families were wrecked, communities destroyed, and we felt betrayed. But, we were fighters, we were gritty, and we stuck together. And we never lost the basic American value of respect for work and respect for workers.For 40 years, my grandfather, John Rizzi, was a steelworker. One day, late in his life on a snowy wintery Ohio morning. he asked me to take him grocery shopping. We'd go to one store for meat, another for cheese. He was always looking for the sale. Many hours later, with one last stop, I asked, ''Grandpa, could we please go to the closest store?''And he said, ''No! The meat cutters are on strike, and we will not cross that picket line.''That's how I was raised. That's how many of you were raised. When in doubt, we are on the side of the worker. Because we respect the men and women who punch a clock, the ones who shower after they get home from the job. We respect the fighters who go to work early, stay late, and pour their hearts into what they do.But Donald Trump? Not so much. He's been stabbing workers in the back for years. Trump got rich ripping people off, stiffing small businesses and contractors. And now he says he's gonna bring our jobs back?  Hey, Ohio, we ain't buying it! This guy cut deals to make the Trump line of products in China, Mexico, and Bangladesh! Not Youngstown, not Akron, not Niles! And if he really cared about our jobs, he would have hired some of our people! Trump will take care of millionaires like himself. There's no doubt about that. But the rest of us? We'll end up holding the bag, again. Economists say he's promised so many tax breaks to rich guys and corporations, it will cost us 3.5 million jobs and put us $30 trillion deeper in debt. Meanwhile, he says he'll let Wall Street gamble with our economic security, again. This isn't a roadmap for a better future, it's what tanked our economy in 2008. Donald Trump is not on our side.But you know who is? Ñ Hillary Clinton. She respects workers, and she's got a plan to help them. In her first 100 days, she'll make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II. She'll put people to work repairing roads, bridges, and schools. And her ''Make it in America'' plan will put $10 billion into rebuilding our manufacturing sector.These initiatives will be a huge shot in the arm for our autoworkers, our steelworkers, and our friends in the building and construction trades. And Hillary Clinton has proposed a plan that lets workers share in the profits they help create, because Hillary knows that working people built this country, together.Our workers deserve respect. They deserve peace of mind, and our workers deserve a piece of the pie. They deserve a President who will put them first, and it's up to us to elect one.As a Catholic school boy. my favorite Bible verse became Isaiah 6:8. ''Then I heard the voice of the Lord say, &#8216;whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' . here I am; send me.'' At every stage of her life, Hillary has said, ''Send me.'' When our children needed health care, Hillary said, ''Send me.'' When our first responders in New York and New Jersey needed support after 9/11, Hillary said, ''Send me.'' When President Obama needed a Secretary of State to rebuild America's standing in the world, Hillary said, ''Send me.'' When African-Americans needed the right to vote, Hillary said, ''Send me.'' And each of these times she got it done! So now it's our turn.Find out how you can get involved. You can even download Hillary's App. Take out your phone and text APP to 47246. And let's send her all the way to the White House. Because just like workers on the job, we are stronger when we are together. Stronger together when our economy works for everyone. Stronger together when we work with our allies to keep our nation safe. Stronger together when every citizen has an opportunity to live the American dream. And tonight you'll hear from Hillary Clinton on how she will lead us to our best days, together.Thank you so much!",,,,
Tom Wolf,"As governor of Pennsylvania, it has been an honor to host you here in Philadelphia this week. Two years ago, I ran for governor on the fundamental belief that society can only succeed when we build prosperity and share it broadly. But, you know, this wasn't a lesson I learned in politics. It was a lesson I learned in business.After serving in the Peace Corps and earning a PhD from MIT, I surprised my family and friends by coming home to Central Pennsylvania to work in the family business -- a building materials company where I started out driving a forklift. Eventually, I bought the company along with two of my cousins and we became one of the largest suppliers of kitchen cabinets in North America.One of the keys to our success was that we recognized that in business, you are only as good as the people you have in your company, and thus, you had to treat everyone like they mattered. Why? Because in fact they do matter. Now, I understand that not all businesspeople see it this way. When we contracted with a vendor, we paid that vendor. Donald Trump? He stiffed hundreds of small businesses, from plumbers to painters, ruining their companies as he sought to enrich himself. At our company, like at many others all across the country, we treated our female employees with respect. When they had kids, we celebrated them, and we gave new moms paid leave. Donald Trump said that pregnant workers are an ''inconvenience,'' so it's no surprise that he has put forward no plan for paid family leave.Finally, another important part of our business model was that we had a profit-sharing plan. We knew that our employees contributed to our growth. So, in addition to good wages -- good family sustaining wages -- and really good benefits, we shared between 20% and 30% of our profits with our employees directly. Just to give you an example, in 2013, which was a turnaround year of our company, all of our workers -- hundreds of them -- received an average of $5,000 each in profit-sharing, that could be put toward college tuition, a well-earned vacation, or they could spend it on anything else they wanted. How about Donald Trump? Well, he  runs his businesses so that they only help who? You guessed it Ð Donald Trump.In his six -- six -- bankruptcy filings, he used the process to protect himself and even enrich himself while his employees were left out of luck. We didn't do what we did because we were looking for awards. We did it because it was the right thing to do for our workers. And we did because it was great for my company's bottom line.It was smart business, plain and simple. We were a stronger, more successful business because we were all in it together. Hillary Clinton believes that too.And that's why, as president, Hillary Clinton will reward companies that share profits with employees, not just executives. Under her proposal, companies will get tax credits worth 15% of the profits they share with their employees. The credits would last for two years and would be larger for smaller businesses. Because Hillary believes that if you work hard, you should share in your company's success!She also will fight to raise the minimum wage. She will ensure equal pay for women and guarantee up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, plus affordable child care. That's fair, it's smart, and it's great for our economy because it's good for workers and it's good for businesses.  At this moment, when we need to restore the fundamental American idea that if you work hard, you can get ahead and stay there, we need a president who recognizes that an economy that doesn't work for everyone, doesn't work at all. We need a president who believes that our society can only succeed when economic prosperity is shared broadly.  We need Hillary Clinton!Thank you very much!",,,,
Xavier Becerra,"Good evening! Buenas noches! Thank you! Hey, how about we thank all the volunteers, the police officers, and security; the workers who set up, cleaned up, and fed us Ð who've made this convention a success?Now, anyone here an immigrant or the child or grandchild of immigrants? Anyone the first in your family to go to college? Who here makes a living working with your hands, making this country better?This is what a great America looks like. So when I hear someone say, ''America isn't great,'' it hits me, like when someone says, ''your father was just a ditch digger; your mother wasn't even born here.''This election is about us. It's personal. It's about telling every little boy and every little girl: You can be the president of the United States of America. When she was 18, my mom came from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. She was the boss. She judged so many thing so well. She juggled her jobs at home and as a clerical worker. My father -- he had to leave school by the sixth grade to help support the family. I remember: He would leave for work long before my three sisters and I would get up for school. When you work in the fields and in construction, you rise with the sun. In winter, when Sacramento turned cold and rainy, and the construction jobs disappeared, my dad would somehow find other work Ð laying a tile floor, canning tomatoes, or hauling someone's trash. My parents didn't go to college, but they encouraged us. And like so many of you, I became the first in my family to graduate with a four-year degree. I know that education opens doors.  Hillary Clinton gets that. She understands that every child deserves a great education, no matter their zip code. As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary had what she called the ''Chelsea test''. If a school wasn't good enough for her daughter, it wasn't good enough for anyone's child. That's why as president, she'll bring preschool to every four-year-old in America. She'll rebuild our crumbling schools. She'll give our teachers the support and tools they need, and the pay they deserve.How many of you have student debt? Hillary will fight for debt-free college tuition, because nobody should be priced out of college. And she'll ensure folks can refinance their student loans, because nobody should be held down by the crush of student debt.I recently went with Carolina, my wife, to witness our youngest daughter, Natalia, graduate from high school. Natalia knows the sky's the limit. Hillary wants for all children what we give to our children. Hillary wants to build schools. Donald Trump wants to build walls. His idea of an education plan Ð Trump University.He once demanded that President Obama release his college transcripts because it would be -- quote -- ''very revealing.''You know what I think? I think it would be ''very revealing'' for Donald Trump to release his college transcript. Who here thinks he did as well as he says he did?At every stage in his life, Donald Trump has exploited America's laws to put himself first. He uses lawsuits the way my mom uses coupons to drive down the price of products. He uses bankruptcies Ð six of them Ð like a wealthy man's get-out-jail-free card. I can't tell you if this man has ever had a callous on his hands. Does he know the price of a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread? And why don't we know about his tax returns? Why won't he release his tax returns? What is he hiding? Why won't he show the American people who he is?Now, let me tell you who Hillary Clinton is. A few months ago, Hillary came to my city of Los Angeles and sat down with people like my parents: grandmothers, DREAMers, and men who work all day in the sun, yet they remain in the shadows. As the meeting ended, the crowd swelled around her. She took every photo requested with families who had never been anywhere close to a future president. People who couldn't even vote. She embraced them. She listened to them. And guess what? She proved that she cares. It's these moments that make this election personal, that define who a president will be.The Hillary I've known for 24 years is someone who has always listened to those who have been silenced. Our next Vice-President Tim Kaine nos escucha tambin Ð ''he listens to us too.''We've come a long way from the days when my dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of the signs that read, ''No dogs or Mexicans allowed.'' Now is not the time to turn back. There's a saying in Spanish Ð Dime con quin andas y te dir quin eres Ð ''Tell me with whom you walk and I will tell you who you are.'' Hillary Clinton has walked with us all her life.No matter who we are, or where we come from, or what we look like, or how much money we have, or who we love, Hillary Clinton walks with us. So, now, the question is: Are we going to walk with her? Are we going to fight for a nation where love trumps hate? Are we going to build an America that's stronger together? Then, together, let's elect the next president of the United States, Hillary Clinton!Thank you very much!",,,,
