Willie Robertson,"Thank you. I'm honored to be here.As some of you know, we end every episode of Duck Dynasty with a family prayer at the dinner table. So tonight, I want to start with a prayer: ''Father-God, bless our time here tonight. Let everything we say and do be pleasing and acceptable to you, and please bless our country.''I've always said that I have three things in common with Mr Trump. We're both successful businessmen. We've both had hit TV shows. And we both have intelligent wives who are MUCH better looking than we are.It's been a ROUGH year for the media experts. It must be humbling to be so wrong about so much for so long.But I have a theory about why they missed the Trump Train: they don't hang out with regular folks like us who hunt, fish, pray and actually work for a living.Heck, they don't even know how to talk to people from middle America. You tell them you're from Louisiana and they usually start talking REALLY SLOW AND REALLY LOUD.Let me tell you why I've been on the Trump Train from the beginning. When you grow up in the South with rednecks, there are some occasional -- disagreements. Disagreements sometimes turn into -- fisticuffs. But anytime I was ever in a bad spot, I always knew my brothers would have my back.Today -- in a lot of ways -- America is in a bad spot. We need a president who will have our back.I can promise you this: no matter who you are, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.If you're looking for a job, or trying to grow a business, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.If you're a serviceman fighting overseas -- or a cop keeping us safe at home -- DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.If you're an average American who feels like you've been forgotten -- neglected by far away leaders -- that the deck is stacked against you and you just can't win -- DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.He may not always tell you what you want to hear -- you may not always agree -- and it may not always be politically correct. (But when your dad is Phil Robertson, you get used to that sort of thing.)But Donald Trump will always Ð always Ð tell you the truth as he sees it.And that's why we can trust him to make America great again as our next president.Thank you, and God bless you.",1,0,0,
Rick Perry,"In 2006, Anita and I had the pleasure of touring a Naval base in San Diego. Our guide that day happened to be a Navy SEAL recovering from combat- related injuries.He was a Texas boy, plainspoken and respectful, and his love for America came through loud and clear. As we parted ways that day, we told him if you're ever in Austin, come on  by.Now, some might call that meeting blind chance or a twist of fate, but I call it the grace of God.We kept in touch over the years, through a tour in Iraq and his return to Texas, until one day, he showed up on our doorstep, unannounced, with nowhere else to turn.We welcomed him into our home, helped him get the care he needed, and today, he's like a second son. Many know about the battles he fought in Afghanistan, but few know about the battles that he, and thousands of veterans like him, face when they come home.Tonight, our commitment is this: Making America great again starts by  taking care of our veterans. ",1,0,1,
Scott Baio,"Thank you for that warm welcome. Thank you so much.Tonight's theme is ''Making America Safe,'' so I want to thank all the brave men and women who serve our country, including retired Lt. Col. Charles Kettles, who just this morning received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Vietnam.And I want to thank Mr Trump for asking to be here tonight. I can't tell you how much of an honor it is to stand up here and talk about a man that I trust with the lives of my family and the health of our country.America: The greatest country God ever created.Now, America is an easy place to get to.But for you first-time voters, it's important for you to know what it means to be an American. It doesn't mean getting free stuff.  It means sacrificing. Winning. Losing. Failing. Succeeding. And sometimes doing the things you don't want to do Ñ including the hard work Ñ in order to get where you want to be. And that's what it means to be an American.But folks, our country right now is in a very bad spot. You can feel it. And you can see it everywhere. There's no stability. Nothing seems right. And all the things that we hold dear are being attacked every single day.We cannot go down this road anymore.We need to stop.We need Donald Trump to fix this.Is Donald Trump a messiah? No. He's just a man Ñ a man who wants to give back to his country: America Ñ the country that has given him everything. A country that has also given all of us so much. And now it's time to give back to her.We have a choice in November. We can go for Hillary Clinton, who wants to continue the same policies that are wrecking this country. Policies that make us unsafe. A woman who somehow that feels she's entitled to the presidency Ñ that she's somehow owed it. Or we can go for Donald Trump, a man doing this from the goodness of his heart and genuinely wants to help. A man who knows how to get things done. A man who says what he means, and means what he says.Hillary Clinton wants to be president for Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump wants to be president for all of us.So, of course, let's make America great again.  But let's make America America again.Thank you all so much.God bless. Go Trump.",1,0,0,
Patricia Smith,"My name is Patricia Smith. My son, Sean, was one of four brave Americans killed during the 2012 terrorist attack at Benghazi. Sean was a wonderful son and father to my two amazing grandchildren, Samantha and Nathan, now 10 and 11. He was proud to serve his country with the United States Foreign Service. The last time I talked to Sean, the night before the terrorist attack, he told me, ''Mom, I am going to die''. ''All security has been pulled from the embassy,'' he explained. And when he asked why, he never received a response. Nobody listened; nobody seemed to care. The very next day he was murdered by radical Islamic terrorists. To this day I don't even know why a computer guy like Sean was sent to Benghazi. That night we lost sons, brothers, fathers, and husbands. We lost four brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country they chose to serve and the American people lost the truth. For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of this cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has brought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton! I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son. That's personally. In an email to her daughter Chelsea shortly after the attack, Hillary Clinton blamed the act to terrorism. But when I saw Hillary Clinton, she lied to me and then called me a liar. When I saw Hillary Clinton at Sean's coffin ceremony just days later, she looked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was responsible. Since then, I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead. I'm still waiting. Whenever I call the State Department, no one would speak to me because they say I am not a member of the immediate family. Sean is my son. Hillary Clinton is a woman, a mother, and a grandmother of two. I am a woman, a mother, and a grandmother of two. How could she do this to me? How could she do this to any American family? Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not. He is blunt, direct and strong. He speaks his mind and his heart. And when it comes to the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism, he will not hesitate to kill the terrorists who threaten American lives. He will make America stronger, not weaker. This entire campaign comes down to a single question: If Hillary Clinton can't give us the truth, why should we give her the presidency? That's right, Hillary for prison. She deserves to be in stripes.",1,0,0,
Mark Geist,"Thank you! Thank you, America, for showing us the support and the dedication that should have been offered by Hillary and her State Department to those who actually saved their asses. September 11, 2012, at approximately 9:35 p.m., 9:40 p.m., we got a call the United States consulate had been overrun. We immediately got our gear ready to go. Got the vehicles ready. And on three separate occasions, we got pulled away by the Chief of Base, Bob, and we got told to stand down. You know, the next thing we know, we hear the State Department over the radio saying, ''Hey, if you guys don't get here, we're all going to die.''Stand down order be damned. The embassy's -- the consulate's under siege. We took off. We left. We weren't waiting no more. As the three of us moved on to the consulate, the first thing you see is the main villa is engulfed in fire and smoke, you know, just pouring out. I moved up to the front steps of the consulate. Off to my right, I see them pulling a body out of the window. Limp body. It ended up being Sean Smith and he was already dead of smoke inhalation by the time we showed up. Myself and Rone continued to move. We went in. Just the heat of the fire just blasting in our face. The smoke just obliterated our sight. It was so thick. We tried to get on our bellies to try to see underneath the smoke. No luck. A little while later, talked to a [incomprehensible audio]. and came through the back gate. As I moved away under the consulate grounds, started searching. After a few minutes.[incomprehensible audio]. helped the State Department guys gather up the classified information, get them ready to go in their armored vehicle, and all of a sudden, we ended up getting a counter-assault. And at that time, instead of the State Department security agents jumping out helping us defend their United States consulate, they took off, which left the six of us to defend the consulate. You know, I got out, went up on the roof of the villa, made my way up towards the back gate. The guy initiated us with an RPG. On this third shot, he was coming out as I was coming over the top of the parapet, I let loose in about a 10 round volley, he dropped. It was calm for about five minutes and then we got word they were gathering another 100 or so terrorists from the drone feed that good old Hillary was watching. And it came to a point where we had to make a decision. You know, at that time, we didn't even know if the United States ambassador was even still at the consulate, if he had been kidnapped prior to us even getting there. But if he was there, he was dead. You know, we had the responsibility of 30 other personnel over at the annex. So we had to make the tough decision and we headed back to the annex without the ambassador. You know, as the team arrived back at the annex, we took up our fighting positions because we knew they were going to be following from the consulate and coming to our place. But you know, we were ready for them. We started seeing movement on the east side of our compound. Then all of a sudden, something came flying over the wall. Had sparks flying from it. Landed between Tieg and I and it exploded. And that's when they opened up on us. But we also unleashed some hell on them. The first wave had about 20 terrorists in it. They went away with a whole lot less.After that first initial firefight, you know, I was just being kind of old. You know, he's like 40 years older than I am so he had to pull out his med kit, grab some gauze, and just like shoving it in his ear. So he finally looks like he has a tampon on but sorry. You know, I kind of smiled at him. I looked at him. ''Hey is that kind of loud much?'' And you know that's because Tieg come right up beside me and stuck his gun right here and fired right next to my left ear. Can't hear out of it to this day. Thanks to him. Should have moved. You know, soon after that, we got word that the support team from Tripoli led by Glen Doherty had landed in Benghazi airport. You think the airport security in the United States is bad, you ought to try to land in an airport in a foreign country controlled by militia that you don't know who their loyalty is to and you've got a bunch of guns and a bag of money. Thank goodness money talks. Mine doesn't. So, you know, going around 1:30 a.m. You still have the United States Ambassador -- he's still missing. And, you know, still we've got movements starting to come up again on our east side. And I get on the radio and say, ''Hey, Bob is there -- are they going to secure the outer perimeter?'' Again, you're looking at 1:30 a.m. -- about 3.5 hours into the attack and we get the answer, ''I don't know.'' Good intel. At that point, a vehicle actually came out of the darkness. A guy jumped out of the vehicle. Immediately drew his arm back. How I saw him, you know, old age with the eyes, you know, picking him out, three rounds in him. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. You know, you would take that guy out and another guy would pop up and then another guy would pop up. You know, it was kind of like that arcade game down on the main strip you always go play -- whack-a-mole. A guy stick his head up and you'd take him out. Another guy stick his head up and you'd shoot him. You know, pretty much about a little bit after that, we got a call that the ambassador was located at the hospital in Benghazi. You know, there's no way for us to determine if this was valid. If he was alive or if he was dead. You know, we don't know if it could have been a trick for us to spread our defense, you know, and pretty much just kind of screw everybody else over at the consulate. You know, we had decided to stay put again. You know, at this time, I had moved where I was at with Tieg and got up on the roof and call it building C. And I was up there with Tyrone. And you know, during the downtime, me and Tyrone had started talking about events that night. And Tyrone had told me about earlier that night when Tieg had saved his life because he got lost in the smoke of the building over at the consulate and he started yelling out for Tieg. And Tieg with total disregard for his own safety after having come out of a smoke-filled room went back in and pulled Tyrone out. It was during that -- and also he was talking about his kids. And he was really -- because all of us had a lot of young kids there. Every one of us that was there. And Jack had just found out that his wife had been pregnant, and so he had a newborn baby coming. And none of us at that point knew if we were going to make it home or not. And this is getting on about that time in the morning about 5:30 when the sun starts coming up and you start seeing that change off on the horizon where the sky turns from really dark -- from that dark blue kind of starting to turn light blue. And you're hearing the morning prayers from the minarets in the distance. About the time the call for prayer finished, we thought, ''Hey, the next tact is going to be here.'' About that time, we heard over the radio that Glen and the team from Tripoli had made their way to the annex and were just getting ready to pull in. And when they did, instead of going inside the building.Glen, he came up on top of the roof. He wanted to get in the fight. So he joined us up there. And Tyrone introduced me to Glen because I'd never met him before. First thing out of my mouth was ''It's good to have another gunfighter up on top of that roof.'' He had kind of turned and he started walking away from me. And it was about that time that the final attack started.A rocket-propelled grenade hit the back wall and small arms fire opened up from the north right in front of me and Ty. A mortar hit on top of our outer wall -- our outer perimeter wall and the State Department guy yelled out that he was hit. Took some shrapnel up into his forehead. We opened up fire. Tyrone opened with a machine gun. I opened up with my assault rifle. And that's when the second mortar hit. It hit about 15 feet to my right. The explosion kind of knocked me back a little bit and as I stood back up, I kind of noticed that Rone was in a fetal position to the left of my feet. And as I raised my left hand up to grab my rifle and start shooting and that's when I noticed that was first injured and my left arm about six inches above the wrist was kind of handing off at a 90 degree angle. It was then that the third mortar hit. And as I glassed over my right shoulder, I noticed that Glen went facedown on the roof and he was out of the fight. I tried again to bring my arm up and grab my weapon I wanted to get back into the fight and it just wouldn't work. I couldn't get it to hold on. And that's when the fourth mortar hit. And that's really the first time that I ever felt like any pain that night. And it felt like I got stunned by a thousand bees. I figured at that time this hard-headed Marine probably ought to get to some cover in case he dropped another one on us. Semper fi. Thank you. So I go for cover and everything went quiet. I pulled the tourniquet out, started to get it on my arm. But I kind of got distracted. I wanted to check on Rone. So I crawled over and tried to find a pulse. Couldn't find one. And it was about that time I saw a shadow come up on top of the roof and that was Tieg. The dust and the debris still hadn't even finished falling when he'd come up on that roof. .You know, as I was standing there, you know, the first round, he was saying Rone was just laying.pretty much. You know, when that first round hits the roof, it just went dead quiet. The debris was so thick. You couldn't see the stars. I mean, it just went pitch black. Pitch quiet. I started moving towards the building C and I get on the radio and I say, ''Hey, you guys all right up on building C?''Of course, I never expected a response at all but the team leader gets on the radio and says ''Hey, we're all right here.'' Of course, you had to tell him to shut up and talk about the guys up on the roof. Jack gets on and says, ''Hey, got no movement.'' Ran over there.You know, the first thing I do I jump over the parapet and the first guy I see is the State guy. He's kind of leaning up against the wall. He's got his pistol out. You know, his left leg just below the knees almost cleanly severed off. His left arm below the elbow is almost cleanly severed off. And I had to disarm him really quick. Lucky he didn't shoot me. Maybe I'd get a medal if he would've. I don't know. I got two tourniquets. Put a tourniquet on his leg. Put a tourniquet on his arm. You know, I'm asking for extra help from the guy's below inside the building. You know, the whole time I'm also doing that, I'm hearing kind of like something crying behind me. It was kind of a weird sound. You don't usually hear that too often in combat. I get him done. I give him back his pistol. I unloaded it of course. You know, you're not going to give him a loaded pistol back. As I started moving across, you know, again I can hear the whimpering and the next thing I know it's [Geist]. He's kind of sitting his back against the wall, playing with his wrist. You know, kind of like a little kid. ''You need to quit doing that. You're going to make it worse.''I kind of figured I was trying to put it back in place but it wouldn't stay there. Yeah, I didn't have any super glue. So he had his tourniquet out. I grabbed his tourniquet. I got his tourniquet on his arm. Stood him up and said, ''Hey man, can you get to the ladder by yourself.'' I told him yeah. Hell yeah, because I knew that Ty and Glen still needed help. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I was still hoping they were alive. So I walked over to the ladder that went down and kind of sat up on the ledge. And I'm sitting there looking down thinking, ''Okay, how am I going to get down off this thing?'' You know, I just survived two or three assaults on our compound and three mortars landed on me, and the next thing you know, I'm thinking ''My luck, I'm going to fall off this darn roof and break my neck.'' You know, those aren't the stories I want my kids to hear about how I died. If I'm going to go out, I want to go out in a blaze of glory. So I ended up hooking my good arm on the top rung of the ladder and I was thinking I'm going to swing my feet down around and land on the ladder. And sure enough, you know, Murphy's law, what can go wrong can go wrong. So right as I slid my feet down, I fell off the ladder. Luckily, I caught myself in my good arm kind of pulled myself back up, got myself together, and climbed on down the ladder. Walked around through the front of the building, meeting one of our other guys coming out. He walked me in and laid me down on the floor. And I was sitting there and they're looking at me. And I told them, ''You know, hey you need to cut my clothes off because I know I've got a bunch of other holes in me. I know there's a bunch of other wounds that need to be treated.'' So finally they got my clothes cut off and we found about 20 or 30 other shrapnel holes. Most of them weren't bleeding too bad so we got the big ones plugged and ready to go again.You know, after I got [Geist] up, he kind of mumbled a little bit because he lost his cane when the motors hit so he didn't have a cane to walk across the roof anymore. But you know, immediately, I went over to where the next guy was which was Rone. I rolled him over, immediately checked for a pulse. His throat moved just a little bit. I didn't get a pulse. So I immediately ripped off his body armor. You know, lift up his shirt and do what they call a Look, Listen, and Feel. Kind of put your ear on their mouth so you're trying to hear or feel their breadth and see if their chest or the stomach's moving at all. Didn't get anything. I got the flashlight, checked for a pupil dilation, and there was nothing. So at that moment, I knew he was gone. And I knew [Geist]. He just went down. And I knew the next radio call was going to be for him and because Rone was also our medic. So I had announced, ''Hey, you know, Rone's gone.'' Got up moved over to the next guy, which end up being Glen Doherty. Again, same like [Geist], never worked with him, never met him. Rolled him over. Same thing. Checked for a pulse. Look, listen, feel. Did a pupil dilation. Same thing. There was nothing. I immediately went back over to Rone, grabbed all of his weapons and stuff like that, kneeled down and said a prayer over him. Went over to [Doherty] and grabbed all his weapon system and kneeled down and said a prayer over him.At that time, you know, we all got off of the roof. And, you know, we knew we had to get out of there. We had to get everyone out of there because there's nothing that we had that could defend against mortar attack. And the fact that a building just got hit by three 81 millimeter mortars and it didn't collapse on everybody inside -- well it definitely wasn't the construction of the building; it was definitely from upstairs. It was the grace of God. Once we got all us wounded stabilized, we secured the dead. We made sure that we didn't have any critical information left behind and that's when we made our way to the airport. To get there, we ended up having to enlist a militia. Happened to be Gaddafi loyalists. Those were the ones that helped -- that Hillary wanted to get out of Libya. They're the ones that helped the Americans get to the hospitals and get to the airport.When we got there, we loaded up the non-shooting personnel. I made my trip in the back of a.pick-up truck -- it's kind of like a Toyota. They came over to me. I was sitting on a gurney, and they came over to grab the gurney. And that's when I kind of sat up and I told them I walked into Benghazi, I'm going to walk out.And that was the same plane that had brought Glen and the guys down from Tripoli. But you know, this was one of the planes that Glen didn't make it back on. You know, the plane that they had secured, the Tripoli team had secured from a Libyan that they actually had just met that day. Again, I don't think it's really a coincidence. You know, we got an over watcher with us that night. You know, we got everybody loaded up, headed to Tripoli, and then we had to turn our tasks. We had to stay behind because they couldn't hold everybody. Again, the Gaddafi loyalist militia stepped up and said, ''Hey, we can get the ambassador.'' They took off. They came back returned with the ambassador's body. Myself, Tonto, and one of the Delta Force guys, you know, checked, made sure it was him, looked him over. You know, he was wearing the exact same clothes he was wearing that morning when I saw him when we went over there because there was a threat at a local -- well, there was a threat at a government compound that day. And you know, he was wearing the exact same clothes. The only difference, you know, he had black soot on his feet, around his fingernails, around his ears. But there was no sign of torture. No sign of mutilation. You know, it was obvious to us he died of smoke inhalation. All those rumors about that happening to him and our government not squashing it right away is a bunch of bull crap. You know at that point, you know, we still didn't know how we were actually going to get out of there. A C-130 starts rolling down the runway. I was thinking this might be for us. It kind of comes a little bit closer but then does a U-turn, pulls off to a little hangar area and shuts down. See all the crew, all the pilots get off. You know, we were kind of standing there a little bit. Well, one of the team members that came down from Tripoli, the linguist that came down from Tripoli went over there and took him about 15 minutes or so and they kind of persuaded the pilot to take us back up to Tripoli. And again, the last Americans to leave Benghazi, we didn't leave on an American plane. But we left on a Libyan plane flown by Libyans. You know, the first United States bird, any United States asset that we saw wasn't a jet. It was a medical transport bird that took us all to Germany about 5 p.m. on September 12th.You know, that night, there were more than 30 American lives that were saved that night. And it's because Americans never give up. We refuse to lose. Benghazi's been a four letter word for the left, but it's not about politics. Benghazi was about opportunities. Opportunities taken when we defied the stand down orders and opportunities squandered when Hillary failed to protect her people on the ground. Had she done her job that night -- had she done her job that night, we wouldn't have had to compromise the annex. Ty, Glen, Sean, and Ambassador Stevens would be alive today. Now, we as Americans -- we have an opportunity, and that opportunity is to elect someone who will make this country safe again. We have to elect someone who will have our backs, someone who will bring our guys home, won't leave anybody behind. We have to elect someone who will lead with strength and integrity, and I believe that person is Donald Trump. We did our part. Every fallen veteran did their part. Now do yours. Now it's time for you to do yours. God bless you. Thank you all!",1,0,0,
Antonio Sabato,"Good evening.I'm honored to be here.I know I am not your typical convention speaker.You might be wondering why I chose to speak. The truth is that I've never considered myself very political or spoken out politically  before.But my belief in this country and my faith in Jesus Christ have compelled me to speak now.I'm concerned about our country's future. I'm concerned about my children's future.And I believe we need Donald Trump, who shares my beliefs and my faith, to get our country back on track.In the past eight years, failed policies have caused our country to deteriorate. Our rights have been trampled and our security threatened.We are weaker by almost every measure. We are on the wrong path.It is clear even to someone who was not born here. I came to the United States from Rome in 1985.I followed all the rules and finally became a naturalized citizen in 1996. Others who want to come to the U.S. to live and work should follow the same rules. We are a nation of laws for a reason.There should be no shortcuts for those who don't want to pay -- or  wait.My mother was born in communist Prague, escaped the Czech Republic and met my dad in Italy.I know what socialism looks like. I don't want that for my children.But that's the path we're headed down with the leader we've had -- and the candidate he endorses.Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promote division -- don't be fooled -- but Donald Trump is for unity.Donald Trump believes in one America, with liberty and justice for all. Having secure borders, protecting our citizens -- none of this is hateful. This is the responsiblity of the government -- and the right thing to do.Donald Trump will get it done and put us back on the right track. People know this, and that's why they have voted as they have. We can no longer afford to be silent.Our country needs Donald Trump to make us great again. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",1,0,0,
Michael McCaul,"I'm Michael McCaul, Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. And I support the Louisiana police officers who tragically lost their lives. Americans stand with my hometown and we will never forget. And to law enforcement officers across this nation, we are with you and we will always support you. Tonight we heard powerful testimony from people who have been devastated by Obama's recklessness. It's time to take back our country and make America safe again! USA. USA. USA. We need to end sanctuary cities. Keep dangerous people out of our country. And secure our borders once and for all. Our country's national security is at risk. President Reagan once reminded us that America was a shiny city upon a hill. A beacon of hope to the world. But after eight years of weak leadership, our city on a hill is now a city under siege. Today our allies no longer trust us. Our adversaries no longer fear us. And our enemies are plotting against us. This did not happen by accident; it happened by design. It is the work of Barack Obama and the architect of his failed foreign policy, Hillary Clinton. For years they presided over America's retreat. And the consequence is clear. Leading from behind has lead us into danger. When Hillary stopped talking about the war on terror, our enemies noticed. When she helped withdraw our forces from Iraq creating a power vacuum, she paved the way for ISIS to rear its ugly head and our enemies noticed. When four Americans were murdered and Benghazi burned, she blames it on a video, and our enemies noticed. And when she stood on the sidelines while terror hotspots erupted across the globe, our enemies noticed. We've all witnessed the recent attacks in Nice, Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul. But now we are in the crosshairs. Our own city streets have become the battleground. Fort Hood, Boston, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, and Orlando. But instead of protecting Americans, the Obama administration turned a blind eye to the danger. So let's cut through the suffocating political correctness and call the threat what it really is. The enemy is radical Islam. These fanatics have radicalized a religion into a weapon, targeting our way of life. President Reagan once asked, ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?'' But tonight let me ask you this question: Are you safer than you were eight years ago? No.Is our military stronger? Is America still respected? Over and over Obama and Hillary apologized for America and allowed jihadists to spread like wildfire. We cannot afford Hillary in the White House again. We need someone who can repair the damage she's done, take the fight to the enemy, and put America first. That man is Donald Trump. I'm proud to serve as a member of his national security team. And I can tell you this, I can tell you this, Donald will never apologize for American greatness. He will promote it. It's time to unify as a party. It is time to unify as a party. He will never bow down to our enemies. He will stand up to them. And Donald will never allow terrorists to gain ground against America. He will shake the ground they walk on. My father was a bombardier in World War II and participated in the D-Day invasion against the Nazis. His generation often defined as the greatest defeated fascism and communism, handing down a better and safer America to my generation. Now we are in a struggle against the forces of radical Islam and terror, which must be defeated for our children and our grandchildren. A Trump administration will take on this fight and send a clear message to Islamic terrorists. You may have fired the first shot, but rest assured, America will fire the last. Thank you. May God bless America and God bless the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.",1,0,0,
David Clarke,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear: Blue Lives Matter!I want to talk with you about something important, indeed, a concept that five law enforcement officers were murdered and nine more were wounded for earlier this month in Dallas, and for which three more were murdered yesterday in Baton Rouge: that is the importance of Making America Safe Again.I believe that this noble mission is not just a requirement, but a prerequisite for achieving this campaign's goal of Making America Great Again.We simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, and in our communities.I see this every day, at street level where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times. This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, and lifestyle.If you don't believe it, a recent Gallup poll confirms it: more than half of all Americans now worry a great deal about crime and violence, up consistently and dramatically from just a few years ago.For African-Americans that number is 70 percent.Sadly for a growing number of communities the sense of safety that many of us once took for granted has been shattered.Americans don't always feel safe no matter if they are working in a big city, living in a suburb or rural areas all around our great country.I often tell residents of Milwaukee, and the cities and towns I visit that safety is a shared endeavor. It starts with the willing acceptance of people to play by society's rules: a code we collectively agree upon that ensures stability, order, fairness, and respect.It's built on a foundation of trust in each other and in the people who administer and enforce society's rules, which at its foundation is the rule of law.In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote passionately about ''the interrelatedness of all communities and states'' and about our ''inescapable network of mutuality, tying us in a single garment of destiny.''He spoke of the basic morality of the rule of law, provided that it is applied equally to both the wealthy and the impoverished; both men and women, and yes, the majority and the minority.What we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and in Baton Rouge was a collapse of social order. So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcend peaceful protest, and violates the code of conduct we rely on.American law enforcement officers understand that race is and has been a heated issue in our country. Most appreciate the vital need for thoroughness and transparency in pursuit of the greater good in their actions, and in their investigations.These are truths that are self-evident to me, and which I practice, and they are the truths that Donald Trump understands and supports. Donald Trump is the steadfast leader our nation needs.He has spoken passionately to me of his belief in our American system of justice, and he speaks to the values that are at the foundation of our social contract.Throughout his campaign and over many years before he has consistently and constantly raised his voice not only in defense of the character of the American police officer, but the need for ALL people to feel they are being treated fairly and respectfully by law enforcement.Donald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington; no private citizen, not even Hillary Clinton; and no group of people, despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances, can claim privilege above the law.The tradition of the primacy of the rule of law in America is strong. It is in those simple facts and in our acts that we will move forward and toward Making America Safe Again. God Bless you, and may God continue to bless these United States of America.",1,0,,
Darryl Glenn,"Good Evening. My name is Darryl Glenn and I'm an unapologetic Christian, constitutional conservative, pro-life, second-amendment-loving Veteran and I'm your Republican nominee for United States Senate in the number one battleground state in this country Colorado.It's my privilege to stand here and support our next President Donald Trump. I'm often asked, ""Why are you a Republican?"" The Democratic party is the party of handouts and after over 7 years of hope and change, the only thing we have left is change in our pocket.This President ran to be Commander-in-Chief. Unfortunately, he's become ""Divider-in-Chief"".We're more racially divided today than before he ran.But there's more.The New Black Panthers, Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton don't speak for black America.This is not about black America, white America or brown America, this is about the United States of America.Mr. President here's the facts.Neighborhoods have become more violent under your watch.Your rhetoric has a direct impact on the relationship between communities and the police.We can bring this country together.But you must realize that our heroes in ""Blue"" are part of the solution and not the problem. Nobody wants bad cops off the street more than good cops!But to heal our communities, more men need to start helping in the care of their children.Safe neighborhoods happen when fathers and mothers are in the home.But there's more.We also must recognize that evil does exist in this world. The threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism is real.Our troops don't care what Party you represent. They care about having the tools, training and equipment to do their jobs. And, if you put them in harm's way, let them win.And, when they come home honor them and care for their injuries.We must win this election.Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President.We all know she loves her pant suits, but we should send her an email and tell her she deserves a bright orange jump suit.Here's the bottom line:American exceptionalism is alive and well.Evil exists. But as God as my witness, this battle has already been fought and won.Believe we can win.Believe we can change things.Believe that together, we can Make America Great Again.My name is Darryl Glenn. I can't do this without your help.God bless each and every one of you. God bless the great state of Colorado and God bless the United States of America.",1,0,,
Tom Cotton,"For eight years, we've seen what happens when America leads from behind. Leading from behind that's not what the Army taught me. To everyone who agrees that America should lead the way, let me say loud and clear: help is on the way.Let me tell you a story about an Arkansas farm boy. When America was at war, he was in school and then in a comfortable job. But he sacrificed that comfort, against the wishes of his father, who himself had served. He volunteered for the Army. He became an infantryman.That farm boy was my dad. He went to Vietnam in 1969.Thirty-five years later, I did the same. Against the wishes of my family, I gave up my legal career and I volunteered for the Army. I became an infantryman. I went to Iraq and Afghanistan. My dad said he felt like God was punishing him for what he did to his dad.But God wasn't punishing them; God had called us to serve. Just as He calls so many of you.My family isn't extraordinary; in fact, we're very ordinary. From farms in Arkansas to fire stations in New York, many families could tell the same story. The defense of this country is a family affair.We don't fight because we hate our enemies, but because we love our country. We love its freedom. We love that we're born equal and live free, that no one rules without consent.We know these things are worth fighting and dying for because they make life worth living for.Our warriors and their families don't ask for much. But there are a few things we'd like.A commander-in-chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars, calls the enemy by its name, and draws red lines carefully, but enforces them ruthlessly.And politicians who treat our common defense as the chief responsibility of our federal government, not just another government program.This isn't much to ask for, but eight years without it is more than enough. So I say again: In a Trump-Pence administration and with a Republican Congress, help is on the way.No man wants more war if he's planned memorial services for fallen comrades, carried their flag-draped caskets off a plane, and buried them at Arlington National Cemetery.But as Washington said: ''To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.''The purpose of our common defense, after all, is to protect our people so that we can enjoy the blessings of peacefaith, freedom, family, prosperity.My father and his father were willing to fight so that their children and grandchildren might live in peace. That wasn't to be. But my generation is willing to fight so that our children might live in peace.And for that cause, I speak tonight not only to Republicans, but to the millions of Independents and Democrats who share that dream and who wish to make America safe again.Thank you, and God bless you.",1,0,,
Jeff Sessions,"Thank you good friends. Speaking from this podium today is a long way from the rafter seats my wife and I had as college students in Miami in 1972.Our voters spoke clearly on two critical issues in our primaries: trade and immigration. They affirmed Donald Trump and his positions.They oppose Obamatrade. They demand a lawful system of immigration that protects their safety and their financial well-being.Average Americans have been the first to know something is wrong with this economy.Our middle class is steadily declining, with our African American and Hispanic communities being hurt the most. But, the Washington establishment, the media, and big corporations have been in denial.Fellow Republicans, we must understand that the incomes of middle class Americans today are $4,186 per year less than in 1999.This is an economic disaster. We are on the wrong track and the people know it.Yet, Hillary Clinton's plan is more of the same: more government, more taxes, more regulation, more immigration, and more debt.She has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. But the facts are in. They have not worked for our people. When those agreements were signed, Presidents Clinton and Obama promised our dangerous trade deficits with China and Korea would be reduced.  But, the deficit with China has increased five-fold and the deficit with Korea doubled. These are job-killing numbers. Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,554-page Obamatrade Ð the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.This election has also been about immigration. For 30 years, our good people have rightly pleaded for an end to the lawlessness, and for sound immigration policies that are fair and advance the national interest.To this legitimate plea, our elites have responded with disdain, dismissal, and scorn.But is there anyone in America that does not understand that when we bring in more workers than we have jobs for that job prospects and wages will fall? Top economists and the Congressional Budget Office have told us that. Is it too much to ask that we slow down and protect our national security and jobsLet's consider the facts. We lawfully admit 1.1 million permanent residents annually, more than any other country. In addition, we have 700,000 foreign guest workers taking jobs.The majority of these are not seasonal or agricultural. There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year, and almost 500,000 more unlawfully overstay their visas. These are extreme numbers. But the only solution from Obama and Hillary Clinton is to capitulate to the lawlessness and give amnesty and citizenship to all.Understand this. From 2000 to 2014, while our existing population increased by millions, the number of jobs held by Americans actually declined. Amazingly, all the net job growth during that period went to immigrants. Combine that with the reality of efficient businesses, robots, and slow growth.The fact is, we don't have enough jobs for the people who are here. Doesn't this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years? Our duty as elected officials is to get our people jobs first.It cannot be our policy to have workers from abroad take jobs while we provide support payments for unemployed Americans.Bad trade deals close factories, and end high paying jobs. Excess immigration floods the labor market reducing jobs and wages.Improper vetting places our nation at risk of terrorism. Remember, the President has the clear power to ""suspend"" immigration to protect America.Americans want help now. This election will make it happen.That is why we need Donald Trump.Donald Trump is the leader that will bring change.He has the strength, courage, and will to get it done. He is attracting more and more Independents and Democrats to our movement.Donald Trump will kill Obamatrade.Donald Trump will build the wall.DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!",1,1,,
Rudy Giuliani,"For a New Yorker for once on the ticket -- Donald Trump. I'm here to speak to you about a very serious subject -- how to make America safe. The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. They fear for their children. They fear for themselves. They fear for our police officers, who are being targeted, with a target on their back. We pray for our police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge and their families. And we say thank you to the Cleveland Police Department for protecting us. Thank you! We -- we know -- we know the risk you are taking, and we say thank you to every police officer and law enforcement agent who is out tonight protecting us -- black, white, Latino, of every race, every color, every creed, every sexual orientation. When they come to save your life, they don't ask, if you are black or white. They just come to save you! We also -- we also reach out. We reach out our arms with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings -- some justified, some unjustified. Those that are unjustified must be punished. Those that are justified, we must apologize to. It's time to make America safe again. It's time to make America one again. One America!What happened -- what happened to -- what happened to, there's no black America, there's no white America, there is just America?! What happened to it? Where did it go? How did it float away? I know -- I know we can change it because I did it by changing New York City from the crime capital of America to the safest large city in the United States. What I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America. I have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years. And he has created and accomplished great things in my city and all over the world. But beyond that, this is a man with a big heart. Every time New York suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help. He's not going to like my telling you this, but he did it anonymously. When police officers were shot, when firefighters were hurt, when people were in trouble, he came forward and he helped and he asked not to be mentioned. Well, I am going to break my promise to him. I am going to mention it, this is a man with a big heart who loves people. All people. From the top, to the bottom, from the middle to the side. I am telling you this because I am sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign. I am sick and tired of it! This is a good man. And America should be sick and tired of their vicious, nasty campaign. You deserve to know this about your next president. He's been great a great father, father-in-law, grandfather, and friend to me, my wife Judith, and my family for now almost 30 years. I know him personally, and this is a very good and decent man. And he will be a great president!In the last seven months, there have been five major Islamic terrorist attacks on us and our allies. We must not be afraid to define our enemy. It is Islamic extremist terrorism! IÉ I, for the purposes of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism. You know who you are! And we're coming to get you! Failing to identify themÉ failing to identify them promptly maligns all those good Muslims around the world who are being killed by them. They are killing more Muslims than anyone else. It also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences. It did in San Bernardino. It did with Major Nidal. He was yelling ''Allah Akbar''. The only person who couldn't figure out this was an Islamist terrorist extremist attack was Barack Obama, who called it workplace violence! This is why our enemies see us as weak and vulnerable. Donald Trump has said the first step in defeating our enemies is to identify them properly and see the connections between them so we can find them and catch them. To defeat Islamic extremist terrorists, we must put them on defense. If they are at war against us, which they have declared, we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them! This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made -- Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and is putting billions of dollars back into a country that's the world's largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists who are killing us and our allies! We are giving them the money. Are we crazy? Donald Trump will make sure that any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the UN and our allies -- a non-nuclear Iran.Donald Trump is a leader. He will reassert America's position as the nation with the best values to lead the world. It was Hillary Clinton who advocated for the overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya. Now Libya is in chaos. Hillary Clinton is accountable for this and much more. Her dereliction of duty and failure to keep her people safe played a major role, as you heard tonight, in the horrific Islamic terrorists murders on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012 in Benghazi which claimed the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens, U.S. Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and CIA Agents Tyrone S. Wood and Glen Doherty. May they rest in peace. And Clinton and the Obama administration for political reasons lied about the purpose of the attacks, including Hillary Clinton lying directly to the families of the people who were killed right to their face. Hillary Clinton's answer to Congress about the deaths of these four brave Americans because of her gross failures as Secretary of State was, ''What difference at this point does it make?'' What difference does it make? Watch the video yourselves and see the arrogant disregard for American lives lost unnecessarily because of her and then make up your own mind. Anyone who-- It means were getting to them. It means we're getting to them. It means we're getting to them. Anyone who can say that it makes no difference how or why people serving America are killed, should not be entrusted with the awesome responsibility to protect them and us and should not be allowed to be our commander-in-chief. Who would trust Hillary Clinton to protect them? I wouldn't. Would you? Donald Trump will change all of that and more. In short, he will lead by leading, not by following. You know Donald Trump will secure our borders. His opponent has had her chance to do this and she has failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders. She is in favor of even taken Syrian refugees even though the Islamic State has told us they're going to put their operatives in with the Syrian refugees. Operatives who are terrorists who are going to come to Western Europe and come here and kill us. They've told us that and she still wants to take in these Syrians. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. Hillary Clinton's experience is the basis for her campaign. Hillary Clinton's experience is exactly the reason she should not be president of the United States. There's no next election. This is it. There's no more time for us left to revive our great country. No more time to repeat our mistakes of the Clinton-Obama years. Washington needs a complete turnaround and Donald Trump is the agent of change and he will be leader of the change we need. He will make America once again, like the president I worked for, Ronald Reagan, the shining city on the hill. Vote for Donald Trump for a safer America and for an America headed in a different direction -- greatness. God bless our next president Donald Trump and God bless the United States of America.

Melania Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. You have all been very kind to Donald and me, to our young son Barron, and to our whole family. It's a very nice welcome and we're excited to be with you at this historic convention. I am so proud of your choice for President of the United States, my husband, Donald J Trump. And I can assure you, he is moved by this great honor. The 2016 Republican primaries were fierce and started with many candidates, 17 to be exact, and I know that Donald agrees with me when I mention how talented all of them are. They deserve respect and gratitude from all of us. However, when it comes to my husband, I will say that I am definitely biased, and for good reason. I have been with Donald for 18 years and I have been aware of his love for this country since we first met. He never had a hidden agenda when it comes to his patriotism, because, like me, he loves this country so much.I was born in Slovenia, a small, beautiful and then communist country in Central Europe. My sister Ines, who is an incredible woman and a friend, and I were raised by my wonderful parents. My elegant and hard-working mother Amalia introduced me to fashion and beauty. My father Viktor instilled in me a passion for business and travel. Their integrity, compassion and intelligence reflect to this day on me and for my love of family and America. From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life: that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect. They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generation to follow. I travelled the world while working hard in the incredible arena of fashion.After living and working in Milan and Paris, I arrived in New York City twenty years ago, and I saw both the joys and the hardships of daily life. On July 28th, 2006, I was very proud to become a citizen of the United States -- the greatest privilege on planet Earth. I cannot, or will not, take the freedoms this country offers for granted. But these freedoms have come with a price so many times. The sacrifices made by our veterans are reminders to us of this. I would like to take this moment to recognize an amazing veteran, the great Senator Bob Dole. And let us thank all of our veterans in the arena today, and those across our great country. We are all truly blessed to be here. That will never change.I can tell you with certainty that my husband has been concerned about our country for as long as I have known him. With all of my heart, I know that he will make a great and lasting difference. Donald has a deep and unbounding determination and a never-give-up attitude. I have seen him fight for years to get a project done Ñ or even started Ñ and he does not give up! If you want someone to fight for you and your country, I can assure you, he is the 'guy'. He will never, ever, give up. And, most importantly, he will never, ever, let you down. Donald is, and always has been, an amazing leader. Now, he will go to work for you. His achievements speak for themselves, and his performance throughout the primary campaign proved that he knows how to win. He also knows how to remain focused on improving our country Ñ on keeping it safe and secure. He is tough when he has to be but he is also kind and fair and caring. This kindness is not always noted, but it is there for all to see. That is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with. Donald is intensely loyal. To family, friends, employees, country. He has the utmost respect for his parents, Mary and Fred, to his sisters Maryanne and Elizabeth, to his brother Robert and to the memory of his late brother Fred. His children have been cared for and mentored to the extent that even his adversaries admit they are an amazing testament to who he is as a man and a father. There is a great deal of love in the Trump family. That is our bond, and that is our strength.Yes, Donald thinks big, which is especially important when considering the presidency of the United States. No room for small thinking. No room for small results. Donald gets things done. Our country is underperforming and needs new leadership. Leadership is also what the world needs. Donald wants our country to move forward in the most positive of ways. Everyone wants change. Donald is the only one that can deliver it. We should not be satisfied with stagnation. Donald wants prosperity for allAmericans. We need new programs to help the poor and opportunities to challenge the young. There has to be a plan for growth Ñ only then will fairness result. My husband's experience exemplifies growth and the successful passage of opportunity to the next generation. His success indicates inclusion rather than division. My husband offers a new direction, welcoming change, prosperity and greater cooperation among peoples and nations. Donald intends to represent all the people, not just some of the people. That includes Christians and Jews and Muslims, it includes Hispanics and African-Americans and Asians, and the poor and the middle class. Throughout his career, Donald has successfully worked with people of many faiths and with many nations.Like no one else, I have seen the talent, the energy, the tenacity, the resourceful mind and the simple goodness of heart that God gave Donald Trump. Now is the time to use those gifts as never before, for purposes far greater than ever before. And he will do this better than anyone else can and it won't even be close. Everything depends on it, for our cause and for our country. People are counting on him Ñ all the millions of you who have touched us so much with your kindness and your confidence. You have turned this unlikely campaign into a movement that is still gaining in strength and number. The primary season, and its toughness, is behind us.Let's all come together in a national campaign like no other! The race will be hard-fought, all the way to November. There will be good times and hard times and unexpected turns Ñ it would not be a Trump contest without excitement and drama. But through it all, my husband will remain focused on only one thing: this beautiful country, that he loves so much. If I am honored to serve as first lady, I will use that wonderful privilege to try to help people in our country who need it the most. One of the many causes dear to my heart is helping children and women.You judge a society by how it treats its citizens. We must do our best to ensure that every child can live in comfort and security, with the best possible education. As citizens of this great nation, it is kindness, love and compassion for each other that will bring us together Ñ and keep us together. These are the values Donald and I will bring to the White House. My husband is ready to lead this great nation. He is ready to fight, every day, to give our children the better future they deserve. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald J. Trump is ready to serve and lead this country as the next president of the United States. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",1,1,,
Joni Ernst,"Distinguished delegates, Republicans, and millions of my fellow Americans watching around the country, especially those in Iowa: it's an honor to be with you from Cleveland, and to be on this stage with fellow veterans. Among them are Special Operations Master Sargent Jason Beardsley, and my colleague, Congressman and Navy SEAL Ryan Zinke, who you'll hear from shortly.I never would have imagined a small town girl like me, from Red Oak would have the opportunity to serve as the first woman elected to federal office from Iowa: however, my parents always said to my brother, sister, and me that if we worked hard, anything was possible.Growing up, we didn't have much, but what we didn't have in money, my parents, particularly my mom, made up for with tenacity.   She really encouraged us: you'd never hear her say ''no you can't do this.'' Instead, if something was challenging, she'd say ''Joni, we'll figure out a way. If this is what you want, let's make it happen: we'll figure it out together.''That's a trait I carry with me today, and it's something I teach my own daughter. In our household, and in the homes of many of those in the military, including those up here tonight, giving up, quitting or accepting failure are not options. That resilience is not unique to our house: that ''can do'' attitude has served as the foundation of our country for 240 years. It continues tonight here in Ohio, in Iowa, and all around our great nation.In between my freshman and sophomore years in college, I went on an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union. At night, the Ukrainians didn't talk about farming: rather, they wanted to know what it was like to live in a country where they could experience freedom. They wanted to know about our country, a place where anything was possible.When I came home, I realized it wasn't enough to simply enjoy freedom and liberty: I had to do my part to protect and preserve it. So I joined the military which as those of us up here with me know is a tremendously important institution that defends the freedoms that we Americans cherish. I've had the great privilege of serving my state and our country while working alongside some of our nation's finest soldiers. For 14 months I served as a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom where my unit was tasked with running convoys through Kuwait and southern Iraq. Last November, after more than 23 years of service, I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard.As I travel across Iowa and around our great country, I hear from folks who are worried America is no longer leading, but rather following from behind. Those concerns are echoed by our allies around the world, and rightfully so.  The question I hear time and again is ''where is America's leadership?'' There's a void in the world: a deficit that cannot be filled by others. Our country and the world of which we are a part simply cannot afford four more years of this lack of leadership under Hillary Clinton. Our allies see us shrinking from our place as a leader in the world as we have failed time and again to address threats. They are looking for American leaders who are willing to stand up and say 'enough is enough.'Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted. Her judgment and character are not suited to be sitting in the most powerful office in the world.She has already failed us too many times before.Hillary Clinton has failed to stop the expansion of terrorismÑher policies in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria have created more safe havens for terrorism. Shockingly, she continues to support a policy that brings captured terrorists into our back yards. All of us up here believe that's unacceptable. Hillary Clinton has failed to support our alliesÑher decision to back the Iran nuclear deal puts in peril our longtime friends and allies in the region, especially Israel. They have continued to threaten to destroy Israel, both directly and indirectly through its terrorist proxies, such as Hezbollah. They remain the top sponsor of terrorism, which endangers not just Israel, but Europe and the United States. And look at the pathetic track record she and Obama have in the war on ISIS. This administration has called them junior varsity adversaries, ignoring some of the best advice they were given. They represent a threat that is not limited to the Middle East, and which is spreading rapidly. In fact, according to the FBI, ISIS is present in all 50 states. Think about that for a moment. Terrorists from ISIS are in every one of our 50 states.  They will use whatever weapons they have: guns, trucks, knives, poisons, and bombs to kill innocent people.Under this current administration's wayward policies, ISIS continues to spread, while the President fails to put forward a comprehensive strategy to defeat and destroy them.Yet Hillary Clinton has failed to protect our national security in other ways. She jeopardized our safety by deciding our laws don't apply to her, setting up her own private e-mail server, and then lying about how it was used.Our men and women of the armed services do not fail us: they cannot. The veterans beside me did not fail us: they too are individuals of the highest integrity. Our presidents cannot fail us either: how can we accept Hillary Clinton when she has failed them, failed us, and cannot be trusted? She has proven time and again that she is entirely unfit to serve our nation as Commander-in-Chief.For too long Americans have felt abandoned, and their warnings unheard. Donald Trump has heard these voices loud and clear. We cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies.If that is not enough, the Veteran's Administration has been failing those who have served alongside those of us here on stage with me tonight, with scandal after scandal at the highest levels. Inferior care, long wait times, extraordinary inefficiency, and a bureaucracy that has gone wild still continues.We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up to our enemies and stand up for our veterans. We need a leader who will ensure America remains a strong, stabilizing force around the globe, and who will keep us safe here at home.Our country cannot take another four years just like the eight we've just had. It is time to stand up and fight for the security of our children, our grandchildren, and ourselves.With Hillary Clinton it's always about her, when it should be about you. Donald Trump is focused on you. He gave voice to a movement of millions of Americans who are tired of politics as usual, and I know as president he will work tirelessly to keep our nation safe.Now is the time to make America safe again.Thank you, and may God bless all of you, the wonderful state of Iowa, our brave men and women in uniform, and these great United States of America.",1,1,,
Ryan Zinke,"Good evening Cleveland and thank you for hosting! What a night! And Montana you're in the house! You know, I'm honored to be sharing the stage with Senator Ernst and Jason Beardsley and all these distinguished veterans. What a circle of honor. I also proudly represent the great state of Montana and the first SEAL in the House of Representatives. Before I was elected to Congress, I spent 23 years as a U.S. Navy SEAL, and I was a commander in SEAL Team Six. But what I'm most proud of is when my daughter was growing up, I told her two things: Don't join the Navy and don't marry a Navy SEAL. She ignored me; she did both. I'm so incredibly proud. I love you, Jennifer. So, did you ever hear of a place called Gitmo? Let's just say that I'm personally acquainted with many of those individuals experiencing those accommodations. And let me tell you, they need to stay there forever. Ever hear of Chris Kyle, Rob O'Neill, Glenn Doherty, Marcus Luttrell, and Ty Woods? I've had the privilege of working with these fine teammates and Americans. And I've mentored many more whose names you will never know. As a SEAL, there's three factors that accomplish success. The first is teamwork. You need to know without a doubt the guy behind you literally has your back. Secondly, is training. We ought it to every troop in harm's way to make sure they have the right equipment, the right training, and the rules of engagement to win decisively in the field of battle. They deserve no less. And lastly, every SEAL, soldier, airman, and Marine knowns ÒNever Quit''. Without teamwork, training, and never quitting, successful missions, like the one that killed Osama Bin Laden, aren't possible. And, when we don't do things right in dangerous situations, bad things happen. In January, Army Green Beret Matthew McClintock lost his life in Afghanistan, when his unit came under heavy Taliban fire. Commanders on the ground requested air support but they received nothing. This tragedy represents the weakness we have come to expect from armchair quarterbacks like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Sen. Ernst ably described the leadership failures. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both are responsible for these failures. For President Obama and Hillary Clinton, being popular is more important than being Commander in Chief. President Obama and Hillary Clinton abandoned Iraq. President Obama and Hillary Clinton drew a red line in Syria and then refused to uphold it. President Obama and Hillary Clinton watched passively as China and Russia filled the international leadership vacuum that they created. President Obama reached a dangerous nuclear arms agreement with Iran Ð a country whose people and leaders tweet ''Death to America''. And Hillary Clinton remained largely silent. Our world knows this president is weak, and his anointed successor, the architect of Benghazi, is no better. Together, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton brought us ISIS and brought down Benghazi. I shudder to think how many times our flag will fly at half-mast if Hillary Clinton is in the Oval Office. You know, I&#8217;ve been to a lot of funerals and too many funerals. Casualties are unfortunately inevitable in war. But the lives of Sergeant McClintock and four Americans in Benghazi could have been saved with leadership in the White House. Donald J. Trump is not afraid to talk about radical Islamic terrorism. And I can guarantee you, if we go to war, we are going to go to war to win. We need a commander in chief who will support our troops rather than abandon them in Benghazi. We need a commander in chief that will put our veterans in front of the line rather than letting them die while waiting for health care. And we need a commander in chief that will stand with Israel rather than fund Iranian rockets that attack Israel. America, it is time to rally. It is time to rally the troops. It is time to rally around our candidate. It is time to rally around Donald Trump, who will make America safe again. Thank you. God bless America. Goodnight, and God bless all our troops &#8211; men and women who defend her. Montana, I love you. ",1,0,,
Dana White,"Good evening.I'm Dana White, president of the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. You might be wondering why I'm here.I'm not a politician. I'm a fight promoter.To be honest, I was surprised to be invited, but I was honored, and I wanted to show up to tell you about my friend, the Donald Trump that I know.In 2001, when my partners and I bought the UFC, it was considered a blood sport.State athletic commissions didn't support us.  Arenas around the world refused to host our events. Nobody took us seriously.Nobody -- except Donald Trump.Donald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC... and encouraged us to build our business.He hosted our first two events at his venue. He dealt with us personally.He got in the trenches with us and made a deal that worked for everyone. And he showed up to the fights and sat in the front row. Yeah, he's that guy. He shows up.Donald championed the UFC before it was popular, before it grew into the successful business that it is now. I will always be grateful to him for standing with us in those early days.So tonight, I'm standing with Donald Trump.Let me tell you three things I respect about this man.First, Donald has great business instincts. He supports businesses of all sizes.He'll make it possible for them to grow and succeed, which is the backbone of a strong economy.Second, Donald is a hard worker.He will roll up his sleeves, he will work with people, and put in the time to get things done.And third, for over 15 years, Donald Trump has been a loyal and supportive friend.I know that if I need him, he'll be there for me, just like he was when we first met. Sometimes he'll call just to say, ''Hey Dana, I'll be watching the fights this weekend. Good luck,'' and he's always reached out when something good happens in my career.In 2011, we signed a huge network TV deal with FOX, and there was a big write-up about it in the New York Times.Donald sent me the article and wrote on the front of it, ''Congratulations Dana, I always knew you would do it.''And just for the record, Donald and I are not business partners. His interest in me and my business is personal.You can really tell a person's true character when they are happy for someone else's success.And I think that sense of loyalty and commitment will translate into how he will run this country.  And let's honest, we need someone who believes in this country.We need someone who is proud of this country, who will fight for this country.Let me tell you something: I have been in the fight business my whole life. I know fighters.Ladies and Gentlemen, Donald Trump is a fighter. And I know Donald Trump will fight for this country. Thank you.",2,,,
Asa Hutchinson,"Ladies and gentleman, I hail from the great state of Arkansas. We know from personal experience that we don't need Hillary Clinton in the White House. I have been in the public arena during the administration of six presidents, from federal prosecutor under President Reagan, to Congress, the DEA, and then Homeland Security after 9/11. I've seen America at its best, and I have seen America put to the test. There has never been a more urgent time for leadership. America's strength and boldness are desperately needed on the world stage, and a new energy is demanded at home to build our economy and to defeat terrorism.Strength, boldness, and new energy are not words that describe Hillary Clinton. This is the same Hillary we knew in Arkansas and later in Washington for so many years. Hillary always wanted more government and her dreams have only gotten bigger. Regretfully, she offers more of the same. The same uncertain leadership in fighting terrorism. The same failed top-down approach to health care, where Washington tells the states what to do. The same nanny-state regulations that strangle the economic strength of America. If you liked the last eight years, then Hillary will give you double for your trouble. But good things are happening in the states. In Arkansas, we are creating jobs in leading in computer science education. Unemployment is the lowest in the recorded history of Arkansas. And we have $177 million dollars surplus. We can do better though for our country at that national level. We need a president that values the role of the states, will destroy ISIS, and jumpstart our economy. Ladies and gentleman, experience matters. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton emphasized her experience. Yes, experience matters but judgment matters more. Despite her experience, Hillary Clinton's poor decisions have produced bad results. Just think about it. Hillary Clinton's radical attempts at so-called reform of the nation's health care system would have been more destructive than even Obamacare has been. Hillary Clinton's bad judgment, as you heard last night, left us four dead Americans in Benghazi. It resulted instability in Egypt, Syria and Libya, the rise of ISIS, the resurgence of Russia, and emboldened North Korea, inappropriate ties between foreign governments and the Clinton Foundation, and a more dangerous world.When it comes to being commander-in-chief, we don't want a president who, in the words of the FBI, is extremely careless in the handling of classified material. Donald Trump represents a different kind of leadership. He is exactly the kind of transparent, straight-talking, leader America needs right now. A Hillary Clinton presidency will endanger our national security. It will be the wrong direction for our economy and it will undermine the innovation coming from the states.A Trump presidency will be about the art of the possible. Donald Trump is the right leader for our time. Mike Pence is the right leader for our time. Thank you. God bless America.",2,,,
Ron Johnson,"Ladies and gentlemen, ''What difference at this point does it make?'' I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question. ''Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors?'' But instead of doing that, she hatched her cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people. She even lied to the surviving family members of America's fallen heroes. Think about that for a minute. She looked those family members right in the eye and then she lied. And of course, Hillary's cold, calculated lie continues. If we can't trust her to tell us the truth, how can we possibly trust her to lead America? So let me tell you and Hillary Clinton, what difference it does make when America's leaders cannot be trusted and when our commander in chief fails miserably by employing a strategy of peace through withdrawal instead of achieving peace through strength. It made a difference to the young Yazidi woman who I met who was captured and brutalized by ISIS barbarians. The joy of life hauntingly absent in her eyes. It made a difference to the travelers passing through airports in Brussels, in Istanbul who just wanted to get home to their family and friends. It made a difference to the ordinary Americans sharing holiday cheer at a Christmas party in San Bernardino. It made a difference to the young men and women dancing on a summer night at a club in Orlando. And it made a difference to the families watching fireworks at a celebration of freedom in Nice. These are just a few of the examples of Islamic terrorists. Let me repeat that. Radical Islamic terrorists. Slaughtering and brutalizing their innocent victims. So the question is: When will America actually confront this terrible reality? We certainly won't if Democrats win in November. In Wisconsin, I'm running against Russ Feingold -- a man who even after 9/11 was the only Senator to vote against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his 18 year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times. Now he's asking Wisconsinites to give him a fourth term. Just as Hillary Clinton is asking America to give her Obama's third term. The world is simply too dangerous to elect either of them. Instead, America needs strong leadership. Leaders who will jumpstart our economy. Secure our borders. Strengthen our military. And accomplish the goal that President Obama set out over 22 months ago -- we must defeat ISIS and then remain fully committed to destroying Islamic terrorists wherever they hide. It doesn't have to be like this. We shouldn't have to live in fear. But if we want to change that reality, we must understand exactly what is at stake. This is a fight for freedom. This is not somebody else's fight. This is our fight and it is a fight that we absolutely must win. Donald Trump and Mike Pence understand that these must be America's top priorities. They'll be strong leaders working with Republicans in the House and the Senate to achieve a goal that can unite us all -- a safe, a prosperous and secure America. Our future hangs in the balance. We must unify, work tirelessly, and together save this great nation. So God bless your efforts and God bless America. Thank you.",2,,,
Chris Cox,"I want to talk to you tonight about a very personal freedom: your right to protect your life.Because as much as we don't like to think about it, we live in dangerous times.We're worried, and we have reason to be.Because we know government has failed to keep us safe.You have to be able to protect yourself and your family. And that's what the Second Amendment is all about.Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks in the door. dq He's a three-time loser who never should have been  released from prison early. But he was, because some politician wanted to show their ""compassion.""  So what's she going to do?She'll dial 911...and pray. The police will do their absolute best to get there quickly.  But their average response time is 11 minutes.Should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? My fellow Americans, that question is on the ballot in  November.Here's why.Eight years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that we have a fundamental, individual right to protect ourselves and our families with a firearm in our own homes.They should've ruled it nine-to-nothing, but the Second Amendment survived by just one vote. After Justice Scalia's death, that vote is gone.Here's where Hillary Clinton stands.She said, quote, ''the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.''Think about that. All the Supreme Court said was you have the right to protect your life in your own home. Hillary says they got it wrong. It's that simple... a Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is gone.Make no mistake: this election isn't about the next four years. It's about the next forty years, so voting for Hillary Clinton, or not voting, is simply not an option.What's so outrageous is that for the rest of her life, Hillary Clinton will never even think about dialing 9-1-1.For thirty years, she hasn't taken a walk, a nap or a bathroom break without a good guy with a gun there to protect her.So it's easy for her to dismiss a right she will never have to use.  But for the rest of us, the choice to own a firearm is ours to make.And in America, there cannot be one set of rules for the Clintons, and  another set for us.But here's Hillary's problem.American women are the fastest-growing group of gun owners. Millions own firearms.  And millions more are thinking about it.  It's not Hillary Clinton who says women should have that choice. It's Donald Trump.Donald Trump is a life member of the NRA, and so are his sons, Don and Eric, because we're the largest and oldest civil rights organization in  America.We fight for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, because the right to protect your life is the most precious right  you have.If you agree, you have to vote for Donald Trump.If you believe women have the right to choose to own a firearm for themselves, you HAVE to vote for Donald Trump.Friends, the 5 million men and women of the NRA will fight without apology for your right to protect your life.But we are on the cusp of losing this great American freedom, and with it, this great nation.The only way we save it, the only way we save it is by electing Donald Trump the next President of the United States.",2,,,
Mitch McConnell,"Ladies and gentlemen, I've been around a while.And I've been around the Clintons more than anybody should ever have to. A couple years ago, Bill and Hillary camped out in my state telling anybody who'd listen why they ought to vote against me. Tonight I'm here to return the favor.I am a patient man. As a young child in the South, I was struck with polio and forced to stay off my feet for two years.That experience taught me an abiding gratitude for my parents. And it taught me how to wait, which comes in handy when you're leading the U.S. Senate.More than anything, though, my job has taught me the value of trust . how to distinguish between people who are in this to serve others and people who are in it for themselves.I am here to tell you Hillary Clinton will say anything, do anything, and be anything to get elected president.And we cannot allow it.The American People are tired of hearing about the bounty of government while the cost of caring for a family or meeting daily expenses grows out of  reach.Over the past few years, they've seen government officials abuse their office and get rewarded for it. They've seen the middle class shrink.And in the midst of all this they have raised a simple complaint. Who is looking out for us?It is not Hillary.I've had my differences with Barack Obama, but l will give him this. At least he was up front about his plans to move America to the  left.Not Hillary.She lied about her emails. She lied about her server. She lied about Benghazi. She lied about sniper fire.She even lied about why her parents named her Hillary. So I ask a simple question.At a moment when so many feel betrayed by their government. Why in the world would Democrats put forward such a candidate?Hillary has changed her positions so many times it's impossible to tell where conviction ends and ambition begins.In 2010, she said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she's always argued against it.Once a backer of the Keystone pipeline, last year she opposed it. She used to be against sanctuary cities.Then she claimed to be for them.  Who knows where she is now.Friends, not since Baghdad Bob has there been a public figure with such a tortured relationship with the truth.There is a clear choice before us. And it is not Hillary.You know what the next four years will look like with Hillary.And you know that if Hillary is president, we will continue to slide, distracted by the scandals that follow the Clintons like flies.Two years ago, voters delivered a clear verdict on the Obama years by sending a freshmen class of rock star Republicans to the Senate and delivering us a majority that I promised to make you proud of.We'd never hesitate to confront this President.But we'd also do the hard work of tackling urgent problems head on. We have delivered on that promise.We put an Obamacare repeal bill on the President's desk. He vetoed  it.Trump would sign it.We passed a bill to finally build the Keystone Pipeline. He vetoed it.Trump would sign it.We passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. Obama vetoed it. Trump would sign it.And on that sad day when we lost the great Antonin Scalia, I made another pledge that Barack Obama would not fill this seat. That honor will go to Donald Trump.With Donald Trump in the White House, Senate Republicans will build on the work we've done and pass more bills into law than any Senate in years.We passed the first major education reform in more than a decade, and ended common core.We made the first significant reforms to Social Security in three decades. We passed a crucial cybersecurity bill.We imposed sanctions on North Korea.We passed the first major highway bill in more than a decade.We passed a bill to combat the scourge of human trafficking.And just last week we passed, and the president signed, the first major law aimed at confronting the heartbreaking explosion of opioid and heroin abuse.Keep the Senate in Republican hands and we will continue this work.And the remarkable public servants that I am proud to lead in the Senate will not let you down.But put Hillary Clinton in the White House and I promise you this.She will double down on the cynical approach that Senate Democrats seem to revel in these days.Here's what I mean.As we sit here tonight, a terrifying mosquito-borne illness threatens expectant mothers and their babies along the Southern Coast.And just last week, Clinton Democrats in the Senate blocked a bill aimed at eradicating that virus before it spread.They blocked a defense funding bill. A bill that would support the brave men and women who are right now defending us overseas.What do these people think public service is about?  I don't know.But I know this. If Hillary Clinton is our president, nothing will change. So tonight, I ask you to let us continue our work.Let's put justices on the Supreme Court who cherish our Constitution. Let's keep the Senate!And let's elect a President and Vice President who really believe America is exceptional.",2,,,
Paul Ryan,"Thank you all very much.Delegates, friends, and fellow citizens: I appreciate the privilege of addressing this forty-first convention of the Party of Lincoln.As part of my co-chairman duties, let me thank all the people of this beautiful city for looking after us this week. And above all I want to thank the men and women here from law enforcement for your service.You know, standing up here again, it all has a familiar feel. Students of trivia will recall that last time around I was your nominee for vice president. It was a great honor, even if things didn't work out quite according to plan.But hey, I'm a positive guy. I've found other things to keep me busy. And I like to look at it this way. Next time there's a State of the Union address, I don't know where Joe Biden and Barack Obama will be. But you'll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump.Democracy is a series of choices. We Republicans have made ours.Have we had our arguments this year? Sure we have Ð and you know what I call those? Signs of life. Signs of a party that's not just going through the motions. Not just mouthing new words for the same old stuff.Meanwhile, what choice has the other party made, in this incredible year filled with so many surprises?Here we are, at a time when men and women in both parties so clearly, so undeniably, want a big change in direction for America, a clean break from a failed system. And what does the Democratic Party establishment offer? What is their idea of a clean break?They are offering a third Obama term, brought to you by another Clinton. And we're supposed to be excited about that?For a country so ready for change, it feels like we had been cleared for takeoff, and then somebody announced we're all going back to the gate.It's like we've been on hold forever, waiting and waiting to finally talk to a real person, and somehow we've been sent back to the main menu.Watch the Democratic Party convention next week Ð that four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. And let it be a reminder of all that is at stake in this election. You can get through four days of it, with a little help from the mute button. But four more years of it?Not, a, chance. The Obama years are almost over. The Clinton years are way over.Two-thousand sixteen is the year America moves on.From now to November, we will hear how many different ways progressive elitists can find to talk down to the rest of America , to tell voters that the Obama years have been good for you , that you should be grateful, and now, well, it's Hillary's turn.But the problem is very simple. There is a reason people in our country are disappointed and restless.If opportunity seems like it's been slipping away, that's because it has. And liberal progressive ideas have done exactly nothing to help. Wages never seem to go up.The whole economy feels stuck. And for millions of Americans, middle-class security is now just a memory.Progressives like our president talk forever about poverty in America. And if high-sounding talk did any good, we'd have overcome these deep problems long ago.This explains why, under the most liberal president we've had so far, poverty in America is worse Ð especially for our fellow citizens who were promised better and need it most.The result is a record of discarded promises , empty gestures , phony strawman arguments , reforms put off forever , shady power plays, like the one that gave us Obamacare , constitutional limits brushed off as nothing , and, all the while, dangers in the world downplayed, even as the threats grow bolder and come closer.It's the latest chapter of an old story: progressives deliver everything except progress.Yet we know better than to think that Republicans can win only on the failures of Democrats. It still comes down to the contest of ideas. Which is really good news, ladies and gentlemen, because when it's about ideas, the advantage goes to us.Against the dreary backdrop of arrogant bureaucracies, pointless mandates, reckless borrowing, willful retreat in the world, and all that progressives still have in store for us, the Republican Party stands as the great, enduring alternative.We believe in making government, as Ronald Reagan said, not the distributor of gifts and privilege, but once again the protector of our liberties.Let the other party go on making its case for more government control over every aspect of our lives Ð more taxes to pay, more debt to carry, more rules to follow, more judges who just make it up as they go along.We, in this party, are committed to a federal government that acts again as a servant accountable to the people, following the Constitution, and venturing not one inch beyond the consent of the governed.We, in this party, offer a better way for our country, based on fundamentals that go back to the Founding generation. We believe in a free society where aspiration and effort can make the difference in every life, where your starting point is not your destiny, and where your first chance is not your only chance.We offer a better way for America, with ideas that actually work. A reformed tax code that rewards free enterprise, instead of just enterprising lobbyists.A reformed health care system that operates by free choice, instead of by force, and doesn't leave you answering to cold, clueless bureaucrats.A renewed commitment to building a 21st-Century military Ð and to giving our veterans the care they were promised, the care that they have earned.And we offer a better way of dealing with persistent poverty in this country: A way that shows poor Americans the world beyond liberal warehousing and checkwriting, into the life everyone can find, with opportunity and independence, the happiness of using your gifts, and the dignity of having a job.And you know what? None of this will happen under Hillary Clinton.Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way.And, last, let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people, always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything.In America, aren't we all supposed to see beyond class, or ethnicity, or all those other lines drawn to set us apart and lock us in groups?Real social progress is always a widening of the circle of concern and protection. It's respect and empathy overtaking blindness and indifference. It's understanding that by the true measure we are all neighbors and countrymen Ð called, each one of us, to know what is right and kind and just, and to go and do likewise.Everyone is equal, everyone has a place, no one is written off, because there is worth and goodness in every life.Straight from the Declaration of Independence, that is the Republican ideal Ð and if we won't defend it, who will?So much that you and I care about, so many things we stand for, are in the balance in the coming election. Whatever we lack going into this campaign, we should not lack for motivation. In the plainest terms I know, it is all on the line.So let's act that way. Let's use the edge we have, because it is still what earns trust and votes. This year of surprises and dramatic turns can end in the finest possible way Ð when America elects a conservative governing majority.We can do this, we can earn that mandate, if we don't hold anything back, if we never lose sight of the stakes. Our candidates will be giving their all, their utmost, and every one of us has got to do the same.So what do you say we unite this party, at this crucial moment when unity is everything?Let's take the fight to our opponents with better ideas Ð let's get on the offensive and let's stay there.Let's compete in every part of America, and turn out at the polls like every last vote matters, because it will.Fellow Republicans, what we have begun here, let's see it through, let's win this thing, let's show America our best and nothing less.",2,,,
Kevin McCarthy,"Thank you! I'm proud to be a conservative from California. That we have listened and you have told us enough. Enough of feeling like your government is ignoring you. Enough of Washington bailouts and handouts. Enough of feeling less safe and less secure in a more dangerous world where the bad guys are winning and the good guys are losing. But I have good news. In 112 days, it is over! Now, in this election, the stakes have never been higher. Do we settle for the path we are on, or do we take a better way. Now, Republicans believe that families who work hard should get ahead. Republicans believe in America that isn't divided by race, religion, or gender. Republicans believe that America only works if we put your interests above the special interests.But that is not what has happened for the past eight years. For eight years we have had a president who's promised us so much but delivered so little. The lies we were told about ObamaCare. The destruction of jobs and entire industries. The empowerment of Iran and the rise of ISIS. Republicans have a better way. We have a plan to fix it. And under Republican agenda, our enemies will fear us. Our taxes will be fairer. People will be able to afford the health care they want. The people's voice will be heard. Government will help those who truly need it, and it will allow everyone to rise. So to those that are left behind by economic forces out of your control, we hear you. To those who are attacked for your beliefs, we hear you. To a nation that sees chaos spreading across America and across that globe, we hear you. And for our men and women in uniform, we hear you.Now as a matter of principle, you will have the very best America has to offer. Those who have fought in the front lines should never have to wait in line. There is a better way. But this Republican agenda can only be realized if we disrupt the status quo. And let's admit, Hillary Clinton is the definition of status quo. We need a leader who shapes the future. The Democrats won't bring the future because they are stuck in the past.When innovation has brought more power to the people, Democrats want more power for Washington. When innovation advances technology, Hillary Clinton uses it to put American secrets at risk. This is not the path for our country. In these difficult times, I remember the words of President Ronald Reagan when he described America as that shining city upon the hill. Together, electing a Republican Congress, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, we can build a better America and make that shining city on the hill bright again. Thank you.

Michael Mukasey,"Over the years, Hillary Clinton has done a lot and said a lot to show why she should not be president.But how she treated government secrets as Secretary of State, and what she said before and after she was caught, sums up the case against her.She sent and received secret, and top-secret, and beyond-top-secret emails on an unsecure private email system instead of on the secure government system Ð and she did it without authorization.She said Ð falsely Ð that there was no classified information. She said Ð  falsely Ð that what she did was authorized.And what else did she say Ð falsely? She said, ''When we traveled to sensitive places like Russia, we often received warnings from department security officials  to leave our blackberrys, laptops Ð anything that communicated with the outside world Ð on the plane, with their batteries removed to prevent foreign intelligence services from compromising them.""She said, ""Even in friendly settings we conducted business under strict security precautions, taking care when and how we read secret material and used our technology.'' That's from her book. The title of the book -- ironically Ð is ''hard choices.''In reality, we now know that she chose to use her private email overseas, in countries hostile to the United States and that have sophisticated hacking capability. Although her system was so remarkably primitive the FBI could not figure out whether or not it had been hacked, we know that the emails of people with whom she communicated were hacked.About her emails we have to ask ourselves the infamous question that she asked about the death of four Americans in Benghazi Ð ''what difference, at this point, does it make?''Well, it makes a big difference.This is the only country in the world that was founded on a law Ð the Constitution.Hillary is running for an office Ð the presidency -- whose powers and duties are defined by that law. The most important power that law gives the president is to be commander in chief of the armed forces Ð to protect the  country.That law imposes on the president the duty to ''take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' That law Ð the Constitution Ð specifically requires that before taking up those powers and duties, the president swear to ''faithfully execute'' the office, and ''preserve, protect and defend'' the  Constitution.Hillary Clinton took a similar oath before she became secretary of state.What that means is that Hillary Clinton is asking us, as Americans, to make her the first president to take the oath of office after already violating that oath.Our message for anyone watching these proceedings should be simple: NO WAY.",2,,,

But this election is not just about Donald Trump.It is also about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.In the past few weeks we have seen this Justice Department refuse to prosecute her.Over the last eight years, we have seen this Administration refuse to hold her accountable for her dismal record as Secretary of State.Well, tonight, as a former federal prosecutor, I welcome the opportunity to hold her accountable for her performance and her character.We must present those facts to you, a jury of her peers, both in this hall and in living rooms around our nation.Since the Justice Department refuses to allow you to render a verdict, let's present the case now, on the facts, against Hillary Clinton. She was America's chief diplomat. Look around at the violence and danger in our world today every region of the world has been infected with her flawed judgment.But let me be specific so you can render your verdict. In North Africa, she was the chief engineer of our disastrous overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.Libya today after Hillary Clinton's grand strategy? Libya's economy in ruins, death and violence in the streets and ISIS now dominating the country.Hillary Clinton, as a failure for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity by ISIS guilty or not guilty? In Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an Al-Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list.What happened because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self proclaimed champion of women around the world? These terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young girls two years ago.These schoolgirls are still missing today.What was the solution from the Obama/Clinton team? A hashtag campaign! Hillary Clinton, as an apologist for an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women guilty or not guilty? She fights for the wrong people.She doesn't fight for us. She doesn't get the real threats America faces. In China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance President Obama's bloated stimulus plan.So desperate for Chinese cash, she promised to oppose the Buy American provision in the stimulus bill in exchange for the cash to finance his huge expansion of government spending.Hillary Clinton, putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of jobs for middle class Americans guilty or not guilty? In Syria, she called President Assad a ''reformer'' and a ''different kind of leader.''With 400,000 now dead -- think about that. Four. Hundred. Thousand. Dead.At the hands of the man Hillary defended.We must ask this question: Hillary Clinton, as an awful judge of the character of a dictator-butcher in the Middle Eastguilty or not guilty? In Iran, she led the negotiations that brought about the worst nuclear deal in history.Let me be clear: America and the world are measurably less safe and less respected because of the Iran deal Hillary helped cut.Period. After she launched those negotiations, she became the biggest cheerleader for it at the end.A deal that will lead to a nuclear Iran, an Israel that will be less safe and secure and much more dangerous Middle East.Hillary Clinton, as an inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history guilty or not guilty? In Russia, she went to the Kremlin on her very first visit and gave them the symbolic reset button.The button should have read, ''delete'' she is very good at that because she deleted in four years what it took 40 years to build. The next year, she said our goal was to strengthen Russia.Strengthen an adversary led by a dictator who dreams of reassembling the old Soviet empire? What a dangerous lack of judgment.Once again, as a flawed evaluator of dictators and failed strategist who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East is Hillary Clinton guilty or not guilty? In Cuba, Hillary Clinton supported concessions to the Castro brothers and got almost nothing in return for ending the embargo.She supported a deal that didn't even require this murderous regime to return a cop killer, JoAnne Chesimard, to face justice.Chesimard murdered a New Jersey State Trooper in cold blood, fled to Cuba and lives there to this very day.How do you live with your own conscience when you reward a domestic terrorist with continued safety and betray the family of fallen police officer waiting for decades for justice for his murder? Hillary Clinton as coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fallen Trooper Werner Foerster guilty or not guilty?Finally, here at home, in one of her first decisions as Secretary of State, she set up a private e-mail server in her basement in violation of our national security.Let's face it: Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she did about protecting America's secrets.Then she lied about it over and over again.She said there was no marked classified information on her server.The FBI Director said that was untrue.She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI Director said that was untrue.She said all work related emails were sent back to the State Department.The FBI Director said that was untrue.As to Hillary Clinton, putting herself ahead of America guilty or not guilty? Hillary Clinton, lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment guilty or not guilty? Time after time the facts, and just the facts, lead you to the same verdict both around the world and at home.In Libya and Nigeria guilty. In China and Syria guilty. In Iran and Russia and Cuba guilty.And here at home on risking America's secrets to keep her own and lying to cover it all upguilty. Her focus group tested persona, with no genuineness to be found, is a sham meant to obscure all the facts and leave you able to vote for her. We cannot promote someone to Commander-in-Chief who has made the world a more violent and dangerous place with every bad judgment she has made.We cannot make the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United States someone who has risked America's secrets and lied about this to Congress and the American people.We didn't disqualify Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States the facts of her life and career disqualifies her. We in this hall agree with all of this.But I want to talk to all of you at home, in your living rooms. You are the ones who will decide this election. We have an alternative.We have a man who is unafraid.We have a man who wants to lead us.We have a man who understands the frustrations and the aspirations of our fellow citizens.We have a man who judges people based on their performance regardless of your gender, race, ethnic or religious background. We do not need to settle for less.We cannot reward incompetence and deceit. We need to demand more than what Hillary Clinton offers for America.We know exactly what four years of Hillary Clinton will bring: all the failures of the Obama years, but with less charm and more lies. It is our obligation to stop Hillary Clinton now and never let her within 10 miles of the White House again.It is time to come together and make sure that Donald Trump is our next President.I am proud to be part of this team.Now let's go win this thing.",2,,,
Tiffany Trump,"Thank you all so much.It's so amazing to be with you tonight and say a few words about my father and your nominee for president. Please excuse me if I'm a little nervous. When I graduated college a couple of months ago, I never expected to be here tonight addressing the nation. I've given a few speeches in front of classrooms of students, but never in an arena with more than ten million people watching. But, like my father, I never back down from challenges, so here I am, a little new to the convention scene but incredibly honored and very confident in the good man that America is coming to know.It's often said that with enough effort and determination you can do whatever you put your mind to. But saying those words and living them are different things, and my father has lived them. It's one of his defining qualities and I've seen it in action all of my life. Whatever he does, he gives his all and does it well. His desire for excellence is contagious. He possesses a unique gift for bringing that trait out in others, starting with those closest to him. He's always helped me be the best version of myself by encouragement and by example. He motivates me to work my hardest and to always stay true to who I am and what I believe. That's what he does: he draws out the talent and drive in people so that they can achieve their full potential. That's a great quality to have in a father and better yet in the president of the United States.As a recent college graduate, many of my accomplishments are still to come. But my dad takes such pride in all that I've done so far, no matter how big or how small. I still keep all of my report cards, some dating back to kindergarten, because I like to look back and see the sweet notes he wrote on each and every one of them. Contrary to what you might expect from someone who places an emphasis on results, my dad's comments referred often to the sentiments expressed by my teachers, about how I acted in and out of the classroom, just not even focusing on the letter grades themselves. Donald Trump has never done anything halfway, least of all as a parent. My father always asked about my family in Georgia to make sure that they are healthy and safe. My uncle served in Vietnam and my 97-year-old grandfather served in World War II.I believe the measure of a person is revealed in their darkest times. For me, the measure of a parent is based on how they support and bolster you when you're down. A few years ago, someone very dear to me passed away and the first call I got, as I knew I would, came from my father. Without his unwavering support and care for me during such a challenging time, I don't know how I would have made it through.As far too many know, it is the small, loving acts that help an enormous amount in times of grief. My father is good with advice, as you might guess, but he keeps it short, and the takeaway is usually the same: to help us find our own way, and our own gifts. If you do what you love, hold nothing back, and never let fear of failure get in the way, then you've pretty much figured out the Trump formula.My dad is a natural-born encourager, the last person who will ever tell you to lower your sights or give up your dream. I always look forward to introducing him to my friends, especially the ones with pre-conceived notions because they meet a man with natural charm and no facade. In person, my father is so friendly, so considerate, so funny, and so real. My friends walk away with a glimpse of all that he is and all that he means to me of the strong, protective, kind, and endearing man I am so proud to call my father.I never pictured myself saying all of this to a packed arena, but I am grateful and fortunate for the chance. I have admired my father all of my life, and I love him with all my heart. God bless you, and thank you.",2,,,
Donald Trump Jr,"Good evening. I'm Donald Trump Jr. Thank you. I'm the father of five young children, from two-year-old Chloe to Kai who just turned nine. I'm the husband to Vanessa, an amazing wife and mother, and the son of a great man. I'm an American, and tonight I want to talk to you about the country we live in; the country our children will grow up in. To my generation, this is the most important election of our lifetime, one that will determine the future of our country and, in turn, the future of the world.For too long, our country has ignored its problems, punting them down the road for future generations to deal with. In business, I was trained by my father to make the tough investments and decisions today to ensure a better future for tomorrow. We've actually started to believe that solving our great problems is an impossible task, and that's why we need to elect a man who has a track record of accomplishing the impossible.For the first time, parents no longer think that their kids will be as well of as we were. We've lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions. But remember one thing: we're still Americans, we're still one country, and we're going to get it all back. We're going to get it back better than ever before. I know we'll get it back because I know my father.I know we'll get it back because I know my father. I know that when people tell him it can't be done that guarantees that he gets it done. I know that when someone tells him that something is impossible, that's what triggers him into action.When people told him it was impossible for a boy from Queens to go to Manhattan and take on developers in the big city, rather than give up he changed the skyline of New York.I've seen it time and time again, that look in his eyes when someone says it can't be done. I saw that look a little over a year ago when he was told he couldn't possibly succeed in politics. Yes, he did.For my father, impossible is just the starting point. That's how he approaches business projects, that's how he approaches life, whether it's teaching his granddaughter how to swing a golf club, or tackling the toughest negotiations, he's always fully committed.That's why the person who had never run for office before stood on the stage 11 months ago in this very arena with 16 professional politicians and this week that same man will stand before you as our party's nominee for the president of the United States of America.As a proud son and family member, it was one of the great honors of my life to be able to put him over the top in the delegate count earlier today.His unrelenting determination is why he's going to become our next president and why I know that when my father says he can fix the country he means it.You want to know what kind of president he'll be? Let me tell you how he ran his businesses, and I know because I was there with him by his side on job sites, in conference rooms from the time I could walk.He didn't hide out behind some desk in an executive suite, he spent his career with regular Americans. He hung out with the guys on construction sites pouring concrete and hanging sheetrock. He listened to them and he valued their opinions as much and often more than the guys from Harvard and Wharton locked away in offices away from the real work.He's recognized the talent and the drive that all Americans have. He's promoted people based on their character, their street smarts and their work ethic, not simply paper or credentials. To this day, many of the top executives in our company are individuals that started out in positions that were blue collar, but he saw something in them and he pushed them to succeed.His true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they don't even see in themselves......The potential that other executives would overlook because their resumes don't include the names of fancy colleges and degrees.I know he values those workers and those qualities in people because those are the individuals he had my siblings and me work under when we started out. That he would trust his own children's formative years to these men and women says all you need to know about Donald Trump.We didn't learn from MBAs, we learned from people who had doctorates in common sense.Guys like Vinnie Stellio, who taught us how to drive heavy equipment, operate tractors and chainsaws, who worked his way through the ranks to become a trusted adviser of my father. It's why we're the only children of billionaires as comfortable in a D10 Caterpillar as we are in our own cars.My father knew that those were the guys and gals that would teach us the dignity of hard work from a very young age. He knows that at that heart of the American dream is the idea that whoever we are, wherever we're from we can get ahead, where everyone can prosper together.The other party also tells us they believe in the American dream, they say we should worry about economic inequality and immobility. You know what? They're right. But they don't tell you that it was their policies that caused the problem and it was their policies that have no accountability.They gave us the worst immigration system in the world, one that imports immobility, one that drives down employment and wages for Hispanic Americans, for African Americans and for everyone, an immigration system that favors illegals over those trying to go through the process legally and, at times, even over law-abiding citizens.It was Bernie Sanders himself who warned that a large tide of new workers keeps wages low and poverty high.The other party gave us public schools that far too often fail our students, especially those who have no options. Growing up, my siblings and I we were truly fortunate to have choices and options that others don't have. We want all Americans to have those same opportunities.Our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class, now they're stalled on the ground floor. They're like Soviet-era department stores that are run for the benefit of the clerks and not the customers, for the teachers and the administrators and not the students. You know why other countries do better on K through 12? They let parents choose where to send their own children to school. That's called competition. It's called the free market. And it's what the other party fears.They fear it because they're more concerned about protecting the jobs of tenured teachers than serving the students in desperate need of a good education.They want to run everything top-down from Washington. They tell us they're the experts and they know what's best.The other party gave us a regulatory state on steroids. Dodd- Frank was a thousand pages long and it's already spun off 22,000 pages in regulations.Imagine trying to digest all that before you even open your doors for business. That doesn't help consumers. What it does is destroy small business in favor of big businesses who can afford the vast number of lawyers and accountants needed to comply. Dodd-Frank is consumer protection for billionaires.We've produced the thickest network of patronage and influence of any country at any time in world history. It's composed of a self- satisfied people at the top, our new aristocrats. We can't live that way any longer, it's too risky.Let me talk a little bit about risks. The other party is the party of risk. I've spent time with many great Americans who have served this country in the military, and they know what's at stake. When we have weak leaders in positions of power, Americans risking their lives for our freedoms are less safe.You know, almost daily I get a call or a text from a real American hero. His name is Mark Geist and I'm proud to call him a friend.Mark was part of the security team at the annex on our grounds at the consulate in Benghazi. Mark was one of the men who received frantic phone calls from his buddies at the compound, calls that pleaded for help, calls that he and his team tried to answer. But calls didn't save all his friends because Secretary Clinton's State Department had ignored their requests for help, both on the night in question and even in the weeks and months leading up to the attack.It was a tragedy and one that would be repeated were she to win the election. Ask Mark who's fit to lead, who has the judgment to lead, who will take that call at 3:00 in the morning? Or better yet, ask yourselves, if you were in Mark's shoes that night, who would you rather call?Let me tell you something about risk. If Hillary Clinton were elected, she'd be the first president who couldn't pass a basic background check. It's incredible.Hillary Clinton is a risk Americans can't afford to take. She says she'll issue executive orders to take away Americans' guns. She wants to appoint judges who will abolish the Second Amendment.Just look at how effective those laws have been in inner-city Chicago, a city with the toughest gun laws in our nation, where 70 people were murdered last month alone and where over 3,400 American lives have been lost since this administration took office in 2009.You know why those laws fail? Because criminals by definition don't follow laws. Rather than prosecuting real criminals, she would strip hardworking, law-abiding citizens of their rights to protect themselves and their families. She'll throw every possible obstacle in the path of safe, reliable, affordable energy produced in America, by Americans, for American businesses and families. Rather than being energy independent, our country will be forced to remain beholden to her buddies in the Middle East.Those are risks we can't afford to take. And when we win, we're not going to have to.There's so much work to do. We will not accept the current state of our country because it's too hard to change. That's not the America I know. We're going to unleash the creative spirit and energy of all Americans. We're going to make our schools the best in the world for every single American of every single ethnicity and background.We're going to put Americans first, all Americans, not a special class of crony elites at the top of the heap.We're going to elect a president who will work with everyone to pass legislation that will make our country great again, a president who will give us a tax code that will free the American economy and end special loopholes for the wealthy, a president who will give us an immigration law that protects American citizens and gives them jobs, a president who will repeal and replace ""Obamacare"" without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors, as Hillary Clinton has proposed.A president who knows we can't simply delete our problems, but that we have to tackle them head on. A president who won't allow PC culture to put the safety and well-being of our children and our loved ones at stake. A president who won't bow and pander to nations that shudder at the very thought of America's existence. A president more concerned with the safety and comfort of his fellow Americans than the feelings of those hostile nations abroad who, if given the option, would wipe America off the face of this earth.A president not beholden to special interests, foreign and domestic, and one who funded his entire primary run out of his own pocket just to prove it. A president who will secure and defend the borders of the United States and who will appoint judges who believe that freedom requires a limited government. A president who won't use the highest office in the land as a path to personal enrichment.A president who's actually created real jobs, who has actually signed the front of a paycheck, and who doesn't just talk about it in theory. A president who has real people's families and livelihoods dependent on his success and the success of his company for decades.A president who speaks his mind, and not just when it behooves him to do so, who doesn't have to run a focus group or use data analytics to be able to form a simple opinion. Who says what needs to be said and not just what you want to hear. A president who will unleash the greatness in our nation and in all of us, who will give the hardworking men and women who have built this great country a voice once again.That president can only be my mentor, my best friend, my father, Donald Trump.And when we elect him, we'll have done all that. We'll have made America great again, greater than ever before.Thank you, and God bless.",2,,,
Shelley Moore,"Let me start out with a question. Are there any mountaineers in the audience tonight? I'm Shelley Moore Capito, the first woman ever elected to serve the state of West Virginia in the United States Senate.Ladies and gentlemen, we face challenging times, times in which we as leaders must ask: How can we secure a future that's brighter for our next generation? That's always the challenge of leadership, and this election is no different.But with every challenge comes great opportunity and that opportunity is what I would like to speak to you about tonight.Let me first tell you where I come from. The Mountain State.I'm a lifelong West Virginian, and with our tight-knit communities, I always say: Our state is just one big small town. That's never been more evident than in the past month as West Virginia was ravished by flooding that upended our communities, displaced our families, and claimed 23 lives.As I travelled the flood zones, I was inspired by people who despite losing everything, sought ways to help to help and serve others. The stories are so tragic yet so uplifting and I am so proud of my state.In their jobs and communities West Virginians work hard every day and deliver results, and in turn, they expect our countries leaders to do the same. The constant refrain I hear back home is, ''Stop, the bickering. Improve the economy, and fight for our jobs.''And let me tell you something, they're right!The greatest obstacle for West Virginia families and families across America over the past eight years has been a president that places left-wing priorities and campaign promises over their livelihoods.President Obama has hurt the heart and soul of my state -- our proud coal miners and the communities where they live and work and pursue their happiness. His policies have ripped through the heartland, creating a cycle of pessimism and disgust.People around the country feel the Obama administration has kicked them to the curb but the callousness that's damaged their ability to trust and respect government.in 2008, President Obama famously said, if someone wants to build a coal-powered plant they can; it's just that it will bankrupt them. Well, eight years later, it's safe to say his actions have matched his words.But he's never realized that when you bankrupt a coal company, you deprive communities of their livelihood. His recklessness has cost more than 60,000 -- 60,000 -- coal workers their jobs since 2011. That's 60,000 families that are now without work, without a paycheck, and without many options.Well, not to be outdone, Hillary Clinton has already promised to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. She wants to put thousands of more Americans out of work. She has promised to devastate communities and families across the coal country.When I think about Hillary Clinton's pursuit of an anti-coal agenda, do you know what I think about?I think about that miner that wakes up at dawn every day to go to a 10-hour shift. I think about that bus driver who drives the miners' children to school. I think about the nurse who cares for our retired miners. And I think about the hundreds of coal equipment distributors.I weep for the fabric of my state. I weep for the fabric of my stateThese men and women take pride in their highly skilled and good-paying jobs that provide for their families and support their communities. They work tirelessly to power America.West Virginia workers are the backbone of this economy. And Hillary Clinton is promising to put them out of work?Now, we shouldn't be surprised by this because Hillary Clinton understands coal miners and blue collars workers about as well as she understands secured email.A day in the life of a coal miner and a day in the life of Hillary Clinton could not be more different.For over 25 years, she's thrived in a world where the rules bend to her.Recently we learned she showed extreme carelessness with our nation's secrets.For others, the consequences of misusing classified information have been swift and serious. But not for Hillary Clinton.Since the end of her husband's administration, she's profited from closed door speeches with fees that would buy several houses in the state of West Virginia.Not only is she out of touch, her attempts to reach out to the American people often reveal how distorted her vision has become.But what I find most troubling is that Hillary Clinton fails to recognize that her calculated policies affect real people -- those who want to feed their families, own homes, pay for college, pursue the American dream. These goals should not and cannot fall out of reach.You may remember when President Obama arrogantly proclaimed that he would slow the rise of the oceans and heal our planet.So what did he do? He introduced and implemented sweeping environmental regulations without Congress's approval and without any consideration for the economy.These unilateral actions are ill-informed and quite frankly unconstitutional.Right now, right now the burden of government regulations in this country amounts to $15,000 a household.So let me ask you a question. A couple questions. Are you ready? Alright.Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 worth more applause lines at campaign rallies?Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 worth more campaign cash?Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 worth a few more one liners?Well, I couldn't agree with you more. And I'm sure you agree with me about the importance of this election.One of the reasons this election is so important is because the Democrats have nominated a candidate that Americans overwhelmingly distrust.You know what? She's earned this reputation. Her term at the State Department was shrouded in scandal and mistrust.Just a few weeks ago, FBI Director said that Secretary Clinton was negligent. He questioned her judgment and revealed countless ways she has misled the American people.We know that the cornerstone of our global leadership is not just our awesome military, it's not just our economic power, but it's our credibility. She has squandered American's trust.And thankfully the latest misdeed hasn't slipped passed the attention of the American people. Recent polls show that voters' distrust of Hillary was deteriorating her support.So it does come down to trust. She can't be trusted with classified information or trusted to play by the same rules that you and I play by.And without trust we cannot feel safe and we cannot thrive. No one, no one who has lost the trust of the American people should ever serve as our president.The only thing we can trust Hillary to do is to double down on the same failed Obama policies that are hurting Americans that I just described.We know she will double down on an economic agenda that's led to the lowest workforce participation in decades.We know that she will double down on the war on coal.We know that she will double down on Obamacare.We know that she will double down on far left Supreme Court nominees.We know that she will double down on a catastrophic foreign policy that she herself has orchestrated.The contrast between our vision for the future and that of Hillary Clinton is clear. Now is the time to turn the tide. Are you with me?Let's turn the tide so that unelected bureaucrats no longer mandate regulations that are disconnected from the realities of working Americans.Let's turn the tide from an executive who promotes radical environmental agenda that raises the cost across this country.Let's turn the tide from a Washington who tells us who our doctors are and delivers a lower quality of care.Let's turn the tide to a government that respects the Constitution and protects jobs and the way of life of rural America!This is not out of reach. We can make these visions a reality.This week, we'll officially nominate a candidate who received the most primary votes in the history of our party -- a candidate who understands how to create jobs and grow the economy.Our party wants to allow businesses to create jobs, not regulate jobs out of existence.Our party understands the free market and doesn't try to control it.Our party stands up for hard working Americans like my hard working West Virginian coal miners.Our party will strengthen our military to face growing threats.We must carry this momentum to elect Donald Trump who speaks directly to Americans who have been devastated by the Obama administration. West Virginians know he understands their problems, shares their concerns and by golly is going to do things much differently.The American people know that Hillary Clinton has forfeited her trust and has broken her bond with working Americans. So let's commit tonight to bringing our country together.In the months ahead the stakes are both clear and high. Take this energy from this convention back to your state, back to your home, and work to elect Donald Trump who will make America great again!Thank you.",2,,,
Ben Carson,"I devoted my career to studying and operating on the brain. This remarkable organ defines our humanity.It gives us the ability not only to feel and observe, but also to reason. When deciding who to elect as our next president, we owe it to ourselves and our country to make use of this power of reason to evaluate the character, experience, and intentions of the candidates and make an informed decision.We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out and passively accept what is fed to us by the media or the political elite.One of the most dangerous narratives being advanced by some in our own party is the notion that however dreadful a Hillary Clinton administration may be, the effects will be temporary or harmless.Consider what she already has done in office. Classified information was recklessly revealed.Intelligence officers were exposed. An ambassador and three other American patriots were slaughtered. That kind of harm is irreversible. It is absurd to think  we can ask our enemies to disregard those emails or leave our operatives alone. And unfortunately, we cannot resurrect the dead.Now consider what Hillary will do if elected president.She will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who share her liberal view of an expansive government that is entitled to trample fundamental freedoms.The decisions of a court dominated by Obama-Clinton appointees will effectively set her cancerous policies in stone.She will perpetuate a system that traps our children in failing schools and promotes poverty instead of empowerment.This type of malignant neglect leaves indelible scars on these children and gaping wounds in our communities.The question before us is not whether we should elect a Republican or a Democrat as president of the United States.The question we must answer is whether we want to retain the ideals upon which this country was founded or succumb to Hillary Clinton's New World Rrder that places government in control of every aspect of our  lives.Donald Trump understands this very well. He understands that the blessings of this nation come with the responsibility to ensure that they are available to all, not just the privileged few.This is exemplified by his willingness to take on the establishment against all odds.It is evident in his passion for the American worker.It is found in his desire to put his considerable skills to work on behalf of American interests, not self-interest.I am proud to support Donald Trump -- the extraordinary businessman and the right leader for our time.",2,,,
Rick Scott,"Good evening. My name is Rick Scott, governor of the great state of Florida. Before I begin tonight I want to express my gratitude to everyone who's kept us in their prayers after the horrific and hate-filled terror attack in Orlando a month ago.We have received outpourings of love and support from Americans everywhere.American people sure stick up for each other. On behalf of all the citizens of our great state, thank you, thank you, thank you.I'm old enough to remember when terrorism was something that happened in foreign countries.Not today.How many more times does the evil of radical Islamic terrorism have to occur before the president of the United States will muster the courage to face the truth?How many more Orlandos? San Bernardinos? Or Fort Hoods will happen until President Obama decides to be honest?I cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by the ISIS-inspired terrorist.This war is real. It is here in America.And the next president must destroy this evil.Donald Trump is the man for that job.I met Donald Trump about 20 years ago before either of us decided to run for office. Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be president.A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say, ''We are at a crossroads''.That's not where we are today.Today, America is in terrible, world-record-high debt. Our economy is not growing. Our jobs are going overseas. We have allowed our military to decay, and we project weakness on the international stage.Washington grows while the rest of America struggles. The Democrats have not led us to a crossroads, they have led us to a cliff.Now I know that some have reservations about my friend Donald Trump. Perhaps he's sometimes not polite. He can be a little rough. And for some people he may be too direct. But, this election is not actually about Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton. In fact, it's not the election not about you or me either. This election is about the very survival of the American Dream.It's time for all Americans to put down the partisan banners, vote for the survival of the greatest country in the world, and do the right thing for this country: vote for Donald Trump!Finally, I have some great news. This is the time America has been waiting for. This year, we get to fire the politicians! And who better to let the politicians know ""you're fired"" than Donald Trump?We need a president who is politically incorrect and will tell it like it is. We need a president who isn't afraid of Washington. We need a president who doesn't believe government is the answer to every problem. We need a president who recognizes that great countries have borders. We need a president who will bring American jobs back to America. We need a president who is not afraid to say ""radical Islamic terrorism."" And we need a president who will wipe ISIS off the face of the earth.And on every one of these measures Hillary Clinton fails. She fails. She fails. She fails.America is worth fighting for. Let's make America great again. Let's elect Donald Trump the next president of the United States of America.Thank you and God bless this great country.",3,,,
Laura Ingraham,"You may know me from TV and radio, but my kids know me by my most important name, Mom. I'm a single mother of three adopted children. I'm here tonight supporting Donald Trump because like most Americans, I refuse to leave them a country that is worse off than the one my parents left me.My grandparents were Polish immigrants. My parents grew up in Depression Era New England. My dad enlisted in the Navy in WWII. My mom waited tables until she was 73.  My dad worked at his car wash. They flew the flag at our house and not just on the 4th of July. They scrimped and saved. My mother made my clothes, and wore the same winter coat for 40 years. Any extra money went into the bank for our education. We learned the dignity found in a job well done. My brothers picked tobacco and delivered newspapers. I picked blueberries and raked lawns.You see, my parents didn't believe there were jobs Americans wouldn't do. In the early '70s, watching the news with my mother, I asked her why people were burning the American flag. She answered: ''Because their parents didn't teach them about respect.''Respect. We see it in decline once again. The people don't respect the government.  The government doesn't respect the people, not even our veterans. Politicians don't respect the Constitution. Many don't respect the life of the infant in the womb, or the elderly who languish alone. Others don't respect the police, who risk their lives every day to protect us. Many in public office don't enforce or respect the rule of law. Isn't that right, Mrs. Clinton? Too many citizens and non-citizens don't respect our laws either. And many of our allies don't respect us anymore.It's sad to see this happen to the country we love. This is our home. It belongs to us, our children and our grandchildren. We deserve better and we can do better. Like us, Donald Trump understands that we must turn this around and restore respect across all levels of society. Unlike us, Hillary Clinton believes the status quo is just fine because she helped create it.Donald Trump knows that a nation without borders is not a nation at all. Hillary Clinton doesn't believe in borders. Donald Trump knows that a country must put the interests of its own people first. Hillary Clinton thinks that America is just another nation in a global order. Donald Trump understands that America's greatness comes from her people, her freedom. Hillary Clinton believes greatness can only be found in an ever-growing government that only Her Majesty rules. She believes that there's a government solution to every problem. No, Hillary, you're the problem. And Donald Trump is the solution.We were in a mess back in 1979, too. Only then it was leisure suits instead of pants suits. Many believed America's time was up. But then Ronald Reagan arrived just in time to restore our national confidence, our economy and our military.Donald Trump will do the same. He has pledged to work tirelessly to get our country back on track. We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos, pledge to support Donald Trump now. This is the most important election since 1980. We see stagnating wages, skyrocketing healthcare costs, doubling of the debt, the threat of ISIS, the rise of China. And the Democrats' answer is to nominate someone who helped orchestrate the decline? It has to be a cruel joke.I don't want to sit around and tell my kids stories about how great America used to be. Do you? We never give up. We rise to challenges. We fight and win. We're Americans. We need a president who believes in the Constitution and who will fight for us and with us.To all my friends in the press, you know in your heart why Donald Trump won the nomination. It's because he dared to call out the phonies, the frauds, and the corruption that have all gone unexposed, and that you failed to challenge for far too long. Donald Trump respects us enough to tell us the hard truths about what has happened to our country Ð on issues like immigration, trade, and our diminished status around the world Ð even in the face of unfair criticism and sheer hatred.They had their chance. Now, it's our chance. Let's reject the politics of division. Let's defeat the Clinton Machine. Let's send the consultants and lobbyists packing. Let's give the power back to the people. And let's elect Donald Trump President of the United States.",3,,,
Phil Ruffin,"I've known Donald Trump as a friend and a business partner for over 20 years. You can't be my friend and my business partner for long if you're not honest with me, and good to your word.  I can tell you Donald Trump is both.He's been an innovator and an entrepreneur: no one in our business works harder, or smarter, than he does. Professionally I have seen time and again how he can see what others cannot, and how he has taken properties others took a pass on and made something incredible out of them.As a result of his vision and hard work he has put tens of thousands of our fellow Americans to work, created amazing spaces and places, and made money for himself, and his partners. He has done this in many of our nation's greatest cities such as: Chicago, New York, Miami, and Las Vegas.Let me tell you about one of the deals we did together. About ten years ago, he and I developed Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. As with so many Trump properties, this has innovative design, and attention to detail. Buyers liked it, and it seemed it would be another tremendous success: it was under budget and on time, however, in 2008 the recession hit, and the banks would not finance any additional units. This left us with about 75 percent unsold, and more than a half billion dollars in debt. Ninety-nine percent of people and investors would have walked away: Donald would not give up.He is a fighter, and he saw its incredible potential.I believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep it afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts.Due to Donald's persistence and faith, and my faith in him, we turned it around. Today it has become a huge success. This is just one example.I have seen him do this time and time again.He has put money on the line, both his and mine. He is a developer. He is an entrepreneur. He is an innovator. And he is a leader.He now wants to turn around Washington. When he first told me he was going to run for President, I told him I did not think it was a good idea.I asked him why he wanted to do this, and he simply replied, ''I love America. Our system is broken, and I am going to fix it.''This is the Donald I know, and I know what America needs now: a fighter and an innovator.He sees the potential and he knows what our great country can be if we come together.Donald Trump will fix what is broken in Washington, and Make America Great Again, and you can bet on that.",3,,,
Pam Bondi,"November 8th is a day of reckoning for all those who have abused their power.It's the day when we the people will take back our government.From Washington bureaucrats playing doctor with our health care. To a resident who's been playing fast and loose with our constitutional rights and Russian roulette with our borders.November 8th, is when America feels safe again, because that's when America wins again.Because winning this election means reclaiming something to which I've dedicated my entire career: the rule of law.Laws that make our neighborhoods safe. Laws that make our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone.And Louisiana, now more than ever, laws that back our law enforcement. They have our backs. And Donald Trump will have your backs.But today, these laws are under siege by a president determined to ignore laws he doesn't like, and by a former secretary of state who believes the laws don't apply to her.And by the way, she deserves no security clearance. How do you become president of the United States when you have no security clearance? This lawlessness must stop. Right here. Right now.Donald Trump will stop it.Lock her up, I love that. Stay with me.Donald is going to roll back Obama's unconstitutional executive orders. Hang on.Donald is going to roll back Obama's unconstitutional orders.He will enforce immigration laws to keep us safe, while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams. And California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Donald Trump will take control of our borders, because we must stop the influx of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and my state, killing our kids.Oh, and then there's this. Hillary believes our enemies Ñ this is unreal Ñ Hillary believes our enemies deserve our respect and empathy. Donald Trump believes terrorists deserve to die.Hillary will stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices who will allow government to continue its rampage against our individual rights, with utter contempt for our Second Amendment.I know Donald. And I am proud to know Donald. He will appoint conservative justices who will defend, rather than rewrite, our Constitution.I have one question for all of you here today. Are you ready to send ISIS a message that we are really coming after them?When Donald Trump is president, he will.So America, on November 8th, remember this:If you believe in limited government.If you believe in our historic constitutional rights.If you believe in the rule of law.If you believe it's time for America to start acting like America again.There is only one choice in this election: Donald Trump.America's for Trump. And so am I.God bless America, and God bless the Trump family.",3,,,
Eileen Collins,"From the moment the first Pilgrims arrived on our shores, Americans have been asking, ''what's next?'' We are a nation built by the passion of people who weren't afraid to do something first, to step into the unknown, and pave our own way forward. We are a nation of explorers.In 1961, President Kennedy issued a challenge to America: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. 47 years ago on this very day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin answered that call and walked on the moon. They took with them an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: ''here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969. We came in peace for all mankind.''We landed on the moon to fulfill a leadership challenge and to explore. Exploration leads to innovation and discovery. Our successful robotic missions to Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto have provided valuable new information about our own planet.But in 2011, the space shuttle program ended. The last time the US launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over 5 years ago. We must do better than that!Countries that are strong explore, invent, and discover to remain resilient in a changing world. I am honored to have played a role in our nation's heritage of explorers as the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, joining the ranks of those that have fought to lead the way.We are all so proud of our Apollo program that put our astronauts on the Moon: first, in peace, for all mankind. Nations that lead on the frontier, lead in the world. We need that visionary leadership again. Leadership that will inspire the next generation to have that same passion.We need leadership that will challenge every American to ask, ''What's next?'' We need leadership that will make America's space program first again. We need leadership that will make America first again. That leader is Donald Trump.Thank you and God bless the United States of America!",3,,,
Michelle Van Etten,"I was born an entrepreneur, by six years old I knew it.My dream was to be a circus performer so I decided to have a circus at my house. I made tickets, sold them door to door, I even dressed my baby brother as a clown and taught my dog new tricks. I was ready for my big day.When people started arriving, my parents had no idea about the circus taking place. Embarrassed, they refunded money to my guests and apologized. I was so upset. Afterwards my dad sat me down and told me any dream you have is possible as long as you're willing to do the work it takes to get the job done. Then he added, ''after you go to college.''But I couldn't wait. Taking my dad's advice, I partnered with the neighborhood kids to be part of my circus, and we charged our parents to watch the show. We continued to have our Circus show for over a year. My dad told me I earned great candy money that year!Fast forward 26 years. Planning for my 20th high school reunion, I decided to check out the girls I went to school with. What I noticed was that my girlfriends looked like Barbies and drove BMWs.  I was 30 pounds overweight, a stay at home mom and drove a minivan.I decided I needed a change. I began to dream again. I took a leap of faith and started my own network marketing business from home. Like many people who pursue a dream, I had to learn how to fail forward and never quit.I also had to become the type of person I wanted in my business. Within just two years, my husband was able to retire from 28 years at DOD. Jim Van Etten now homeschools our kids because we choose not to subject them to Common Core.I opened a fashion studio called MV House of Style in Brandon, Florida. Today I run a thriving multi-faceted business. I am living the American Dream.But that dream is in jeopardy. My fear is that the next generation Ð the millennial - who over half of them have an entrepreneurial spirt and want to be their own boss Ð will not be able to because of the liberal policies that have been implemented over the past eight years.These policies Ð including higher taxes and excessive regulations Ð are crushing the American Dream.Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.We need these entrepreneurs.We live in the land of opportunity.We need to protect the American Dream above all else.Are we willing to let government bureaucrats and liberal policies destroy the innovative spirit?If not, then we have to take action.We need a president who is businessman not a Hillary-crat.Who understands small businesses are the backbone of America. Who will not raise taxes.Who will repeal Obamacare so small businesses can start offering insurance to their employees again.Who will end Common Core and protect our children's education. Who will encourage creativity and innovation. Who will bring manufacturing back to America. Who will make America great and safe again.There is only one man capable of this juggling act.  Only one man who can take the circus we've inherited from the last eight years and serve as the ultimate ringmaster.There is only one man who can preserve and protect the American Dream for future generations.That man is Donald Trump. Thank you.",3,,,
Eric Trump,"Wow. Wow. Good evening, Cleveland. Wow. It is such an an honor to be here for a man I love so, so, so so much. That is my father.Thirteen months ago, my father sat my family down and told us the time had come.He could no longer sit idly by and watch our beloved country, the country that had given our family so much success, so much opportunity, crumble before our very eyes.He confirmed to us that he was prepared to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.He made sure to acknowledge that ours would not be an easy path.That we should prepare ourselves for what was to come.That we'd quickly learn who our true friends were.Without hesitation, we each committed our unwavering support.But this time, none of us could have predicted what lay ahead.The records he would break, the stadiums he would fill, the movement he would start.Today my father stands before you with the most primary votes of any Republican candidate in the history of our nation.He shattered voter registration records across the country.He has defied the predictions of every single political pundit and turned traditional debates into must-see TV.He has inspired multiple generations, including my own, millennials like myself who have so little faith in politicians that they no longer even consider public service to be a noble career.A year ago, my father was a businessman.But like many Americans, he simply could no longer stand to see what was happening to our great country.He could no longer stand to see special interest dollars dictate an incompetent foreign policy that puts foreign countries before our very own.He could no longer tolerate an inept administration that considers giving $150 billion to Iran for releasing five radical Islamic terrorists a successful negotiation.He could no longer bear witness to our continued Second Amendment attacks.He could no longer stand to see the word 'Christmas' stripped from public use, or the Pledge of Allegiance removed from our schools in an effort to be politically correct.So my father made the courageous decision to set aside a company to which he has dedicated his entire life, to set aside a global brand that he has made synonymous with success, with quality, with uncompromising ... just the best.At a time when people at the pinnacle of their career like my father would have held fast to a lifestyle that has truly become the epitome of the American dream, my father instead chose to give that dream back to the people it had eluded for so long.As daunting of a journey as he knew it would be, for him, he knew it was the easiest decision in the world.After all, who better to implement a common sense business approach to this country?Who better to apply practical solutions to the impractical decision-making of an administration that has bred a $19 trillion debt, one that goes up by $32,000 a second and over $2 billion a day?Who better to implement common sense tax reductions for one of the highest-taxed nations in the world, allowing our citizens the chance to keep more of what they earn, as opposed to having it squandered away by our inefficient government?Who better to negotiate the return of countless American manufacturers, like Nabisco and Ford and Carrier, and so many others, back to the United States where they began, than a man who has single-handedly employed tens and tens and tens of thousands of people around the country?It's time for a president with common sense.It's time for a president who understands the art of a deal and appreciates the value of a dollar: our tax dollars.It's time for the president who has always been the one to sign the front of a check, not the back.Throughout my father's career, he has been repeatedly called on by government to step in, save delayed, shuttered, and and grossly over-budget public projects, everything from the exterior of Grand Central Terminal in New York to the iconic old post office in Washington, D.C., just to name a few.Back in 1986, the city of New York tried to refurbish a simple ice skating rink in Central Park. The project dragged on for six years and blew up to over $13 million, $5 million over an already-inflated budget.That's when my father, who overlooked this disastrous construction site from his office window each and every day, decided he had to step in.Disgusted by government incompetence and ineptitude, he invested $2 million of his own money in order to complete the project.What had taken the city over half a decade to botch, my father completed in less than six months, two months ahead of schedule and over a million dollars under budget.It's time for a president who can make America great again, ahead of budget, and ahead of schedule, too.My father has revitalized run down neighborhoods, shaped skylines across the country, and turned dreams into reality his entire career. It's what he does; it's who he is.Oprah Winfrey once famously asked my father if he envisioned running for the presidency of the United States. His answer? ""Only if it got so bad that I had no choice."" ""Only if it got so bad that I had no choice.""Well, ladies and gentlemen, that day has come.As I travel the world that my dad built, and the greatest golf courses and hotels and real estate projects, I see the unmistakable look in his eyes.I see in his eyes the indignity and frustration of a domestic infrastructure back at home that is in complete disarray and no longer on par with so many other developed nations. I see in his eyes the sadness of innocent lives lost, like those of Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw and so many others cut short by illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities, victims of a revolving door of government ineptitude and corruption that leaves innocent Americans defenseless.I see in his eyes the humiliation of an education system ranked 30th in the world.I see in his eyes the disgrace of a nearly $400 billion trade imbalance with China, the $60 billion trade imbalance with Mexico, and the continued destabilization of the Middle East, which has cost our nation trillions and trillions of dollars and thousands and thousands of lives.But today I see in his eyes a man who truly loves his country, who is proud of his country, and who wants his country to be great again.I want to thank my father over there for the life that he's provided me, for the life that he's provided my family, and the life that he's provided all of our employees around the world.I want to thank my father for the life that he's enabled me to provide for my future children as my beautiful wife Lara and I start thinking about that amazing chapter of our lives.To that end, I often think about the legacy I wish to leave my children, and to me, there are few things that I hold closer to my heart than charity.For me, it's the essence of who we are as human beings. It's the barometer by which we will be measured for our time here on Earth.As Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ""Life's most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others?""When I was 22 years old, I founded the Eric Trump Foundation, to benefit St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, an incredible, incredible organization.I run my foundation based on the principles my father taught me: honesty, integrity, and values.I expect other charities to be run by the same moral code, not serve as conduit for personal enrichment, not become a beacon of corruption and scandal.To whom much is given, much will be required. This is the very belief that compelled my father to make this great sacrifice, to run for the most powerful yet unforgiving office in the world. There is no greater calling, there is no more selfless an act.To the unemployed voter sitting at home watching me right now, wondering how you're going to make your next mortgage payment, or rent payment, my father is running for you.To the veteran tuning into this speech from his or her hospital, who has been ignored and disrespected by an ungrateful system for far too long, my father is running for you.To the schoolteacher forced to walk through metal detectors each and every day into an underfunded school, my father is running for you.To the laborer who is watching me right now, forced out of job by undocumented workers, illegal immigrants, my father is running for you.To the oil and gas industry worked denied a job because of radical regulations from a radical EPA, my father is running for you.To single mothers, to families with special needs children, to middle class families who can no longer afford medical benefits sufficient to cover their everyday needs, my father is running for you.This November, I ask you to be true to yourself and vote for the candidate who you know is running for the right reasons.Vote for the candidate who has never been a politician.Vote for the candidate who has never received a paycheck from our government.Vote for the candidate who can't be bought, sold, purchased, bribed, coerced, intimidated, or steered from the path that is right and just and true.And quite frankly, friends, vote for the one candidate who does not need this job.Never have I been more proud to be a Trump. Never have I been more proud to be my father's son.I'm incredibly honored to be part of this journey on which he's invited me, Don, Ivanka, Tiffany, Melania, my beautiful wife Lara, our entire family, to play such an integral part.Dad, you have once again taught us by example, you are my hero, you are my best friend, you are the next president of the United States.God bless America.",3,,,
Scott Walker,"My fellow Americans, you have a choice. You deserve better. America deserves better. The well-connected in Washington are lining up behind Hillary Clinton, because she is one of them. They want more of the same.Donald Trump is standing with the American people.We want a leader who is not afraid to take on the mess in Washington.We believe that there is a better way forward.As Republicans, we believe in an America where everyone can get the education and training that they need to succeed in college, career, and life; one where Washington doesn't deepen dependency, but rather helps create genuine opportunity.Why? Because America deserves better.We believe in a country where people can achieve, maintain, and enjoy their piece of the American Dream Ð without the government standing in the way.Why? Because America deserves better.We believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. We name it for what it is: Radical Islamic Terrorism.And we do everything in our power to eliminate it - to ensure our safety.Why? Because America deserves better.We believe in a country where it is a solemn responsibility to deliver to our troops the support and tools they need to achieve victory and then provide them with the health care and respect they've earned when they return home.Why? Because America deserves better.And while we're at it, we believe in a country where those who honorably serve in law enforcement - the people who put their lives on the line for us - are not just respected Ð they are revered.Why? Because America deserves better.We believe in a country where power is taken back from Washington and returned home to state and local governments - where it is more effective, more efficient and more accountable to the people.Why? Because America deserves better.We believe in a country where freedom and personal success do not come from the clumsy hand of government, but rather the dignity that comes from hard work.Why? Because America deserves better.The simple truth is: liberal Washington insiders created these problems. And Hillary Clinton is the ultimate liberal Washington insider. If she were any more on the ''inside,'' she'd be in prison.America deserves better than Hillary Clinton.That is why we need to support Donald Trump and Mike Pence for President and Vice President.Last August, I said that any of the Republicans running would be better than Hillary Clinton. I meant it then, and I mean it now. So let me be clear: a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton.Make no mistake: we can't wait four more years and ''get them next time.'' The consequences are too great. After hearing the FBI Director's recent comments, I wouldn't even give Hillary Clinton the password to my iPhone - let alone access to classified information. This isn't just another Clinton scandal, Hillary's scandal put our national security at risk and that makes her unfit to be President.It's time to tell Hillary: enough is enough. No more double standards for the Clintons.Why? Because America deserves better.Thankfully, Republicans are offering a better way forward.It's working right here in Ohio and in Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Carolina. And even in Massachusetts and Maryland.Republican leadership works. I see it first hand as it's working in Wisconsin.In 2010, we were tired of high unemployment, budget deficits, stifling taxes, and rising college tuition.Most of all, we were tired of the big government union bosses running our state and local governments. We had enough. So we did something about it. We took back power from the big government special interests and returned it firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. In turn, the big government special interests - and their cronies in Washington - helped organize more than 100,000 protestors who occupied our state Capitol. They tried to intimidate us with threats and mobs, but we didn't back down. And we won.Then, they spent tens of millions of dollars to try and defeat us in a recall election, but we didn't back down. And we won.Three times they came at us. Three times we won.We won because our common sense reforms worked. Today, more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before, our budget is balanced and responsible, taxes are down for working families and seniors; and college tuition is frozen for four years in a row.If conservative reforms can work in a blue state like mine, they can work anywhere in the country. You see, it wasn't too late for Wisconsin and it's not too late for America. If you've had enough of Washington's brokenness, wastefulness, empty promises and arrogance, join us. Help us elect Republicans to office - from the courthouse to the statehouse to the White House.You have a choice. You decide. You deserve better. Because America deserves better.",3,,,
Ted Cruz,"Heidi and I are honored to join you here in Cleveland, where Lebron James just led an incredible comeback victory. I'm convinced America is going to come back too.I congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.Conventions are times of excitement. But given the events of the last few weeks, I hope you'll allow me a moment to talk to you about what's really at stake.Just two weeks ago, a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was having a carefree Texas summer Ð swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do.Like most children, she took for granted the love she received from her mom, Heidi, and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith. That is, until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.The day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and kiss as he left for work. But as they parted, her dad asked her something he hadn't asked before:''What if this is the last time you ever kiss or hug me?''Later, as she thought of her fallen father, and that last heartbreaking hug, Caroline broke down in tears. How could anything ever be OK again?Michael Smith was a former Army ranger who spent three decades with the Dallas Police Department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election, or what he thought about this one. But his life was a testament to devotion. He protected the very protestors who mocked him because he loved his country and his fellow man. His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, ''To die of love is to live by it.''As I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith's story weighed on my heart. Maybe that's because his daughter, Caroline, is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name. Maybe it's because I saw a video of that dear, sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her daddy's last question to her. Maybe it's because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil, in places like Orlando and Paris and Nice and Baton Rouge. Maybe it is because of the simple question itself:What if this, right now, is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families and our country?Did we live up to our values? Did we do all we could?That's really what elections should be about. That's why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign.We're fighting, not for one particular candidate or one campaign, but becauseeach of us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, our own Carolines, that we did our best for their future, and for our country.America is more than just a land mass between two oceans. America is an idea, a simple yet powerful idea: freedom matters.For much of human history, government power has been the unavoidable constant in life Ð government decrees, and the people obey.Not here. We have no king or queen. No dictator. We the People constrain government.Our nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most powerful words in the English language: I want to be free.Never has that message been more needed than today.We stand here tonight a nation divided. Partisan rancor, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart.And citizens are furious-rightly furious-at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and ignores the will of the people.We have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.Of course, Obama and Clinton will tell you that they also care about our children's future. And I want to believe them. But there is a profound difference in our two parties' visions for the future.Theirs is the party that thinks ISIS is a ''JV team,'' that responds to the death of Americans at Benghazi by asking, ''What difference does it make?'' That thinksit's possible to make a deal with Iran, which celebrates as holidays ''Death to America Day'' and ''Death to Israel Day.''My friends, this is madness.President Obama is a man who does everything backwards Ð he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and open up our borders, he exports jobs and imports terrorists.Enough is enough.There is a better vision for our future: A return to freedom.On education, your freedom to choose your child's education, even if you aren't as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.On healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor, without Obamacare.On taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.The Internet? Keep it free from taxes, free from regulation. And don't give it away to Russia and China.Freedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.Freedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian or Jew, Muslim or atheist. Gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.Freedom means the right to keep and bear arms, and protect your family.Freedom means Supreme Court Justices who don't dictate policy, but instead follow the Constitution.And freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values. Colorado may decide something different than Texas. New York different than Iowa. Diversity. That's the way it's supposed to be. If not, what's the point of having states to begin with?Hillary Clinton believes government should make virtually every choice in your life. Education, healthcare, marriage, speech Ð all dictated out of Washington.But something powerful is happening. We've seen it in both parties. We've seen it in the United Kingdom's unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.Voters are overwhelmingly rejecting big government. That's a profound victory.People are fed up with politicians who don't listen to them, fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites, instead of working men and women.We deserve an immigration system that puts America first. And yes, builds a wall to keep us safe.That stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees.We deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers and manufacturing jobs over the global interests funding the lobbyists.And if we choose freedom, our future will be brighter.Freedom will bring back jobs, raise wages.Freedom will lift people out of dependency, to the dignity of work.We can do this. 47 years ago today, America put a man on the moon. That's the power of freedom.Our party was founded to defeat slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.We passed the Civil Rights Act, and fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws.Those were fights for freedom, and so is this.Sergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom.So do our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines fighting radical Islamic terrorism.So did the family of Alton Sterling, who bravely called to end the violence.So did the families of those murdered at the Charleston Emanuel AME church, who forgave that hateful, bigoted murderer.And so can we.We deserve leaders who stand for principle. Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody.And to those listening, please, don't stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.It's love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams. Like my Mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my Dad, who fled prison and torture in Cuba, coming to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear.And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving 9-year-old girl in Dallas Ð and, God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar and make her daddy proud.We must make the most of our moment Ð to fight for freedom, to protect our God-given rights, even of those with whom we don't agree, so that when we are old and gray, and our work is done, and we give those we love one final kiss goodbye, we will be able to say, ''Freedom matters, and I was part of something beautiful.''Thank you. And may God bless the United States of America.",3,,,
Newt Gingrich,"Thank you for that very generous welcome. And thank you, Callista. You know, she makes documentary films, writes best-selling children's series on American history, sings in the basilica choir, plays the French horn in the Fairfax Band. I am amazed at her achievements.I'm also proud to be here as a Republican activist to the extra effort Donald Trump has invested in bringing the Republican Party together.With no requirement for endorsement, he encourages competitors to speak once again. Governor Rick Perry, Governor Scott Walker, Dr. Ben Carson, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator Ted Cruz have all responded to Donald Trump's generosity.Now I think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz, who is a superb orator, said, and I just want to point it out to you, Ted Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution. In this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution.So to paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution of United States, the only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket.That way we have a Republican ticket to implement Republican principles in Washington.Now what I want to focus on is a subject that has dominated by thinking for decades, how do we keep America safe? Keeping America safe is the first responsibility of the American president. There have been many fascinating things to watch about the extraordinary historic rise of Donald Trump, but the most significant has been Donald Trump's courage to tell some important truths about our national security.For example, we are at war. We are at war with radical Islamists. They are determined to kill us. They are stronger than we admit. And there is no substitute for victory.In contrast to Donald Trump, our national security and foreign policy elites, led by Hillary Clinton, are incapable of speaking with such honesty while they lie about the threat. We need to tell the truth about the danger.If our enemies had their way, not a single woman in this room could define her future. If our enemies had their way, gays, lesbians, and transgender citizens would be put to death as they are today and the Islamic State and Iran.If our enemies had their way, every person on earth would be subject to conversion by the sword and to a cruel and violent system of law. There would be no individual liberty. There would be no equality. There would be no freedom. If you doubt we are at war, if you doubt that the threat is as real as I say, let me refresh your memory.On Monday, an Afghan refugee in Germany used an ax and knives to slash and wound train passengers while shouting Allahu akbar. Last week, ISIS claimed responsibly after a Tunisian man drove a cargo truck into a crowd in Nice, France. He murdered 84 people including 10 children, three Americans, and injured over 300 others. Two weeks ago, almost 300 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in bombing attacks in Baghdad.Two days before that, radical Islamists in Bangladesh killed 20 hostages, including three American college students. A few days before that, at the Istanbul airport in Turkey, ISIS attackers armed with guns and bombs killed 44 people and injured hundreds more.Last month, a radical Islamist in Paris stalked a French police officer to his home where he murdered the officer, tortured his wife to death in front of the 3-old-son, while streaming it all on social media. He was pondering out loud whether to kill the 3-year-old when he was killed by police.Two days before that, an attacker pledging of allegiance to ISIS killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub, and wounded dozens more.All of this in just the past 37 days. We cannot let ourselves grow numb to these accumulating atrocities. One analysis estimated that since January, 2015, some 30,000 people have been killed at the hands of terrorists. Let's be clear, Donald Trump is right. We are at war with radical Islamists. We are losing the war. And we must change course to win the war.Let me be very clear, because I know the news media will do their best to distort this, we have nothing to fear from the vast majority of Muslims in the United States or around the world, the vast majority are peaceful. They are often the victims themselves. They are people we would be happy to have as our friends and neighbors.The challenge, the challenge is when even a small percentage of a 1.6 billion people support violence against those who disagree with them, that is still a giant recruiting base. For example, Pew Research finds that only 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably.Unfortunately, 9 percent is 16 million people, and that is just one country. So the truth is although we are losing the war with radical Islamists, we have been very lucky.The danger we face is much worse than the horrors that happened in Germany on New Year's Eve when 1,200 women were assaulted. It is worse than what is happening in France where there are stabbings of Jews in the streets and the nation's security chief warned recently that Europe is ''on the brink of civil war.''It is worse than what is happening in Israel where average citizens fear for their lives whenever they leave their homes. The danger is even worse than September 11th when 19 hijackers murdered almost 3,000 Americans. The worst-case scenario is losing an American city to terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction.Instead of losing 3,000 people in one morning, we could lose more than 300,000. Instead of losing two great buildings, we could lose block after block after block after block to a nuclear event.That is not just my view, back in January of 2001, the Hart- Rudman Commission warned the terrorists quote ''will acquire weapons of mass destruction and some will use them. Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.''Fifteen years later, the dangers are even greater in a world where Pakistan has nuclear weapons, where North Korea has been weapons, and where Iran, the world's state sponsor of terrorism, is close to having nuclear weapons, this, a catastrophic attack on innocent Americans is a very real threat.Which brings us to the heart of the matter, we are sleepwalking through history as though this is all about politics. It is not.It is about our safety and our survival as a country. We cannot keep in place the people and the systems that have brought us to this point and then lie to us every single day about the threat. That is why every American should be terrified at the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency. Hillary Clinton has been right at the center of this dishonesty.We know this administration and its allies lied to us about the Iran nuclear deal. We know it because they openly bragged about it to The New York Times. We know that Hillary Clinton lied to us knowingly about the terror attack on our Benghazi consulate. We know that Hillary Clinton and President Obama lie to the American people when they say they can safely screen the Syrian refugees. They cannot.And yet, Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent. So when you hear about Hillary's dishonesty, of the emails, or taking millions from the Saudis or other Middle Eastern dictatorships, remember, this is not about politics. The cost of Hillary's dishonesty could be the loss of America as we know it.The first step forward to safety is electing a leader who will be truthful with the American people about the realities we face. Only then will we understand, support, and demand the strategies require to confront this threat.And because safety and security are the preconditions for our freedom and prosperity, it is also the first step towards rebuilding the America we love.Donald Trump understands this. And that is why he will rebuild our military because he knows that a strong military is the best way to secure peace.Donald Trump will secure our borders because there is no such thing as a nation without a border. Donald Trump will enforce our immigration laws, he will end the policy of deliberate non- enforcement, and will end the abuse of our visa programs to protect American workers and their wages. Donald Trump will take care of our veterans by holding bureaucrats at the Veterans Administration accountable.He will fire those responsible for the waiting lists and will give veterans more choices about their care. With Donald Trump's leadership, no bureaucrat will get between a veteran and their doctor.Donald Trump will get America building again. He will blow apart the ridiculous regulations and requirements that drive up infrastructure cost and drag out the time-line to get anything built.The Trump infrastructure program will make us once again the most competitive economy in the world. Donald Trump will rebuild our education system and give every parent of every income and every ethnic background a choice about where their children goes to school. Donald Trump will help us rebuild and strengthen our communities.Here again, the first step is safety. The basis for strong families and good jobs and vibrant neighborhoods, that means restoring law and order. Donald Trump will show zero tolerance for people calling to the death of police officers.Think about this, if anyone publicly threatens the life of the president of the United States, the Secret Service is on the them an instant. Our law enforcement officers deserve the same respect as the president of the United States.Of course if individual officers are found to have violated someone's rights, they must be held accountable under the law. America is based on the rule of law. We are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.That it what has allowed us to absorb more people from more backgrounds than any nation in history. Nobody is above the law and nobody is too small to deserve its protection. Donald Trump won our party's nomination because he is willing to tell the truth about the things that matter.He has a great running mate in Mike Pence. They will put our safety first and they will defend America first.We can be proud to stand with them.So tonight, the challenge for everyone in this hall and everyone Republican, Democrat, or independent who is watching at home, and knows we cannot continue on our current course, is to rise above our factions, and rise above the politics we have inherited, to ignore the lies of the news media and the old order, to reject the suicidal dishonesty of Hillary Clinton and her establishment allies, and to stand with Donald Trump and Mike Pence for what we know is true.We can make America safe again. We can make America work again. We can make America first again. And together, we can make America great again for all Americans. Thank you and God bless the United States of America.",3,,,
Mike Pence,"Mr. Chairman, delegates, friends and my fellow Americans: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence and on behalf of my family, here and gone, I accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States of America.And let me thank Speaker Paul Ryan for that gracious welcome. Paul, you're a true friend and a great American leader. Paul knows it well, and he knows the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican Ñ in that order.You know, I'm new to this campaign. And honestly, I never thought I'd be standing here. I thought I'd be spending this evening with all my friends in the great state of Indiana. Yet there I was, a few days ago in New York City, with a man who won 37 states; who faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them; and along the way, brought millions of new voters into the Republican Party.He is a man known for having a large personality, a colorful style, and lots of charisma. I think he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.For those of you who don't know me Ñ which is most of you Ñ I grew up on the front row of the American dream. My grandfather immigrated to this country. I was raised in a small town in southern Indiana, in a big family with a cornfield in the backyard. Although we weren't really a political family, the heroes of my youth were President John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.When I was young, I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters. A family, a business, a good name. I was raised to believe in hard work, in faith, and family. My dad was a combat veteran in Korea. My dad ran gas stations in our small town and was a great father. If dad were here with us today, I have a feeling he would enjoy this moment, and would probably be pretty surprised.But it is such a joy for me to tell you that my mother is here. Would you join me in welcoming the light of my life, my mom, Nancy?You know, growing up, I actually started in politics in the other party, until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 40th president, and I signed onto the Reagan Revolution. But the best thing that ever happened to me, even counting tonight, is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams Ñ a schoolteacher and artist. She is everything to me. Would you welcome my wonderful wife, Karen Pence?And regardless of any title I will ever hold, the most important job I will ever have is spelled D-A-D. Karen and I are blessed. We are blessed to be the parents of the three greatest kids in the world: A writer named Charlie, a college student named Audrey, and a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, Michael J Pence. I'm so proud of you guys.If you know anything about Hoosiers, you know we like to suit up and compete. We play to win. That is why I joined this campaign in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down Ñ a fighter, and a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself, against all odds. But this week, with this united party, come November 8, I know we will elect Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States of America.We will win because we are running on the issues facing this country, and because we are leveling with the American people about the stakes and the choice. The American people are tired of being told. They're tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. Tired of hearing politicians in both parties tell us that we will get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of debt on our children and grandchildren. As Ronald Reagan used to say, we're tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.In the end, this election comes down to just two names on the ballot; So let's resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become President of the United States of America. Hillary Clinton essentially offers a third Obama term. The role is perfect for her. She championed Obamacare because years earlier she had all but invented it. The national debt has nearly doubled in these eight years, and her only answer is to keep borrowing and spending. Like the president, she thinks that the path to a growing economy is more taxes and more regulation and more government.They tell us this economy is the best that we can do. It's nowhere near the best that we can do. It's just the best that they can do. Let me tell you, I know firsthand, it dow not have to be like this. In my home state of Indiana, we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and healthcare.You know, Indiana is a state that works because conservative principles work every time you put them into practice. The nation suffers under the weight of $19 trillion in national debt, we in Indiana have a $2 billion surplus. The highest credit rating in the nation, even though we've cut taxes every year since I became governor four years ago. We have fewer state employees than when I took office, and businesses large and small have created nearly 150,000 new jobs. That is what you can do with commonsense Republican leadership, and that is exactly what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald Trump will bring to the White House.Donald Trump gets it. He's the genuine article. He is a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. When Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn't tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness. He is his own man. Distinctly American. And where else would an independent spirit like that find a following than in the land of the free and the home of the brave?The funny thing is, the party in power seems helpless to figure out the nominee. The media has the same problem. They all keep telling each other that the usual methods will work against him. They keep thinking that they've done him in, only to wake up the next morning and find that Donald Trump is still standing and stronger than ever before.The man just doesn't quit. He is tough. He perseveres. He has gone about as far as you can go in business, but he has never turned his back on the working men and women who serve and protect us at home and abroad. It has been a heartbreaking time for the women and men in our law enforcement community. In this time of great testing for them, let's let them know here and now, all across this country, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line of law enforcement in America.Now, while Donald Trump was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself. I have seen the way he deals with people who work for him at every level. I've seen the way they feel about working for him. I grant you, he can be a little rough with politicians on stage, and I bet we see that again.But I have seen this good man up close. His utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him, and his devotion to his family. If you still doubt what I'm saying, as we say back home, you can't fake good kids. How about his amazing children? Aren't they something? These are the true measures of our nominee. Chosen by the voters as the right man for these times. This is the outsider, my running mate Ñ turned a longshot campaign into a movement.Over in the other party, the idea was to present the exact opposite of a political outsider. The exact opposite of a calculating truth-teller. On that score, you have to hand it to the Democratic establishment Ñ they outdid themselves this time.At the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names. People in both parties are restless for change, ready to break free from old patterns in Washington, and Democrats are about to anoint someone who represents everything this country is tired of. You know, Hillary Clinton wants a better title. And I would too if I was already America's secretary of the status quo.The choice could not be more clear: Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the field establishment in Washington D.C., or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again. It is change versus status quo, and my fellow Republicans when Donald Trump becomes President of the United States, the change will be huge.For years we have had fundamental problems in America that get talked to death in Washington D.C., but they never get solved. They even get worse.We've seen entire stretches of our country the written off by bad economic policies in ways that are deeply unfair. We see relentless mandates from the executive branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, and no provision of the Constitution is too large for them to ignore.Meanwhile, we have seen borders that go unrespected, A military that has been diminished, promise after ringing promise to our veterans promptly forgotten. Then Donald Trump came along and started saying what practically everybody was thinking anyway, that our leaders need to be stronger.Under Donald Trump, our deals will be stronger. Under Donald Trump, our deals will be smarter, our soldiers will have what they need, and our veterans will have what they earned.The good news is that it will not be nearly enough. Not against a candidate who captures the attention of the country the way Donald Trump has. Issue by issue, he and I will take our case to the voters. Pointing out the failures of the Obama/Clinton agenda and showing a better way, we will win the hearts and minds of the American people with an agenda for a stronger and more prosperous America.Now, Washington D.C. thinks it's only a narrow range of voters who will give Donald Trump a serious look, but I can tell you firsthand, there are a lot of Americans who feel like Democratic politicians taking them for granted. It is union members who don't want a president who promises to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Those miners want an American energy policy, and they know that Donald Trump digs coal.It is African-Americans who remember generations of hollow promises about safe streets and better schools, and they know Donald Trump will fight for equal opportunity, and he loves educational choice. It is Hispanic Americans who respect the law, who want jobs and opportunities for their families, who know that Donald Trump will uphold the law and get this economy moving for every American.You know, the party of Lincoln was founded on equality and opportunity. During these difficult days, it will be our party in our agenda opens the doors for every American to succeed and prosper in this land. In so many ways, the Democratic Party has abandoned those they used to protect. Maybe they've become too entrenched in power. So comfortable at times that they lose patience with the normal legislative process. It's so much simpler to impose their values by executive order or court action, and make no mistake about it: Hillary Clinton has big ideas along those lines.As this election approaches, every American should know that while we are filling the presidency for the next four years, this election will define the Supreme Court for the next 40. We all had better think very, very carefully about what this means for our Constitution and limited government. Elect Hillary Clinton, and you better get used to being subject to unelected judges, using unaccountable power to take unconstitutional actions.For the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life, for the sake of our Second Amendment, and for the sake of all our other God-given liberties, we must ensure that the next president appointing justices to the Supreme Court is Donald Trump.And Hillary Clinton's record on foreign affairs is even worse. It was Hillary Clinton who helped undo all the games of the troops urge. A staggering failure of judgment that set ice is loose. It was Hillary Clinton who instigated the president's disastrous agreement with the radical people of their own. It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi. Then she said, ""What difference at this point does it make?""As the proud father of a United States Marine, let me say from my heart: Anyone who said that, anyone who did that should be disqualified from ever serving as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America.Seven and a half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have weakened Americas place in the world. Terrorist attacks at home and abroad, grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few weeks ago, and the attempted coup in Turkey all attest to a world spinning apart. History teaches that weakness arouses evil. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign-policy of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning resets with Russia, and the rise, rule, and reign of ISIS are a testament to the truth of history.We cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends. America needs to be strong for the world to be safe, and on the world stage, Donald Trump will lead from strength.Donald Trump will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Donald Trump will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemy of our freedom. If the world does nothing else, it will notice: America stands with Israel.If you looked at the calendar this morning, you may have noticed, the presidency of Barack Obama ends exactly six months from today. This much is certain of the Obama years: They are not ending well. There seem to be so many things that divide us, so few great purposes that unite us as they once did. It is at moments like this, moments when politics fail, but I believe we do well to remember what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in America. That we are, as we have always been, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your vice president, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people without it?My fellow Americans, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny and I have faith, faith in the boundless capacities of the American people, and faith that God can still heal our land.But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want a president who will protect this nation, confront radical Islamic terrorism, and rid the world of ISIS; if you want a president who will restore law and order to this country and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve; if you want a president who will cut taxes grow our economy and squeeze every nickel out of the federal bureaucracy; if you want a president who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want to president who will upend the status quo in Washington D.C. and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution; we have one choice Ð and that man is ready. This team is ready. Our party is ready. And when we elect Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States, together we will make America great again.Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",3,,,

Father God, in the name of Jesus, Lord, we're so thankful far the life of Donald Trump. We're thankful that you are guiding him, that you are giving him the words to unite this party, this country, that we together can defeat the liberal Democratic Party, to keep us divided and not united. Because we are the United States of America, and we are the conservative party under God. To defeat every attack that comes against us, protect the life of Donald Trump.

Joe Arpaio,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, I have spent 55 years in law enforcement. 55 years. Have always regarded my work, mission is critical. But my most important mission has just begun -- to help elect Donald Trump, president of the United States. The stakes are high. We need a strong leader who will stand up for America and put the interest of her citizens first. Unfortunately we are losing the battle. We are the only country in the world whose immigration systems puts the needs of other nations ahead of ours. We are more concerned with the rights of illegal aliens and criminals than we are with protecting our own country. That must change. We need a leader who will protect our border and enforce our laws. Because a nation without borders and a nation without laws is no nation at all.And now, more than ever, we must respect and have respect for the police. We must give them the tools and the support they need to do their jobs. The highest levels of government must have our backs as they risk their lives every single day to perform their jobs and to protect our citizens. As someone who for 35 has been a top law enforcement official, living and working on both sides of the border, I can tell you firsthand about the dangers of illegal immigration and drugs.We have terrorists coming in over our border, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem. We have criminals penetrating our weak border security systems and committing serious crimes. I am supporting Donald Trump because he is a leader and he produces results and is the only candidate for president ready to get tough in order to protect Americans.I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration, and I know Donald Trump will stand with me and other proud Americans to secure our border. Donald Trump will build the wall and restore -- restore -- law and order and keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering into our country. You know, I will never forget Donald Trump and what he did for my wife. I have been married to Ava for 59 years and during the campaign she was diagnosed with cancer. Just before going on national TV, Donald Trump called my wife and talked to her for five minutes. And in subsequent trips he never forgot to think of my wife and call her. He did not have to get my support through his kindness to my wife, because I was already hooked. Let's elect a leader who will stand up for America and protect our border and support law enforcement and the military, and in doing so, unite our country. Let's elect Donald Trump! Thank you.",4,,,
Marsha Blackburn,"Hello to everybody here tonight. And to all of you who are watching us at home, on iPhones, and on Twitter, welcome! I have a question for you. Do you want to help make America one again? Let me hear you! Alright! You know, we have all had enough of bloated budgets, unkept promises and pointless red lines. We've had enough division and enough heated rhetoric that serves to only drive a wedge between us and our neighbor. Enough of seeing our 401k's get smaller, our bills get bigger, our taxes go up and our paychecks shrink. In short, the American people have had it. Yes, and they are ready for change. They are ready for someone to take the reins and bring us together. There is someone that can get the job done or as Larry the Cable Guy would say, ''Let's get 'er done!'' There's someone who can come in ahead of schedule and under budget who's read the specs, has seen the bottom line, negotiated the cost and built something to last. A leader who knows that this country is not full of assets to be managed, forgotten, or deleted. Our nation is full of citizens who want a leader who knows the sure route to prosperity, who inspires, who knows that leadership is a hard fought verb and not a subject line in an email. And that is why I am asking all of you to join me tonight in electing Donald Trump as president of the United States. Donald Trump has the skills required to lead this nation, a diverse nation, and he can help our people achieve greatness. He believes in the American dream because he has lived the American dream. You know, the desire for greatness is not new. President Lincoln stood right here in this very city 155 years ago with a call for us to bind together or perish apart. Listen to his words, ''If all do not join now to save the good ship of the union, this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another.''And again, we find our nation in desperate need of true leadership, in desperate need of unity. The last eight years have really been a challenge to our national and our household budgets, to our Constitution, and to the men and women who give their lives and their sacred honor to protect that Constitution and to protect us. We know that Donald Trump is a leader who has seen challenges. He's learned his lessons, solved problems. He has delivered results. Some of our nation's greatest leaders have been people who have worked in the real world, who know firsthand how cumbersome rules and unnecessary regulations get in the way of greatness. I want a president who knows that leadership is not as it appears but it's as it performs, who has seen something through from beginning to completion, who looks at the mundane and sees magnificence. After all, that's the magic of this country. That everyday people with big ideas and big dreams and the drive to complete them, not only can they change a skyline, they can change the world. Leadership is not about lines on a resume. Gender, race, zip code, pedigree, lineage, hurt feelings are not qualifiers for leadership. Leadership is a record of performance and accomplishment and team building. Now that is leadership that you can trust. We Americans are bound together by the shared desire for faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity. We want a president who believes that you, not Washington, knows best, who believes that you have the right to pursue your version of the American dream. I know you believe -- I do too -- that America is on the edge of great and mighty things. We need a President Donald Trump who understands this is about freedom and freedom's causes, who will choose to unite us, not divide us. So, let me ask you another question. Are you with me? Are you with Trump-Pence 2016? Alright! Together, we can get the country building, working, see jobs come back, our communities grow and see leaders actually lead. And together, with you and with Trump-Pence 2016, we will be great again. We will be one again. Thank you!",4,,,
Mary Fallin,"Oklahoma loves New York, too! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Alright, America, I have a question. Are you ready for change? Me, too! Alright, I grew up in Tecumseh, a small town in Oklahoma. It was one of those all American towns where everyone watches high school football on Friday nights and neighbors take care of neighbors. In Tecumseh, we understood poverty but it wasn't a destiny that was inevitable. We were optimistic about our future, and we knew we could succeed with hard work, a good education, and faith in God. There weren't very many opportunities for young women but we did have a great role model -- a woman mayor -- my mom. She taught me if I worked hard, I could be anything, and I took that lesson to heart and eventually became the first female governor of the state of Oklahoma. You know, in my community, there was a sense of optimism and determination that our community and our country could be better for everyone.And even in a time when the shadow of institutional discrimination fell over much of our country, there was no shortage of African-American heroes, black Oklahomans like civil rights leader, Clara Luper, who was leading sit-ins and successfully integrating schools across our state and winning the fight for respect and opportunity. So when I look back on my childhood, my America, I don't see a perfect place, but we were united by a simple belief that no matter who you were or where you came from, better days were ahead for America. Today, I'm afraid we're losing that sense of unity and optimism, not just in towns like Tecumseh but across this land. Our country is divided, our people are afraid and our spirits are nearly broken. But we can't lose that hopelessness and have it become the new normal. And America, we won't! I believe the American people are longing for the American dream where they can just get a fair shake in life and the opportunities to succeed. We must make America one again and restore the confidence and the strength of our nation. And it's no secret, Donald Trump is bold, tenacious, courageous, and he's an outspoken leader.And he knows how to create jobs and successful businesses. He has bold ideas and he speaks truth to power. He is a man who will get this country on the right track, who believes in peace through strength, and will protect America against radical Islamic terrorists who seek to destroy our nation. Our country has united time and time again on our core values of freedom and individual liberty and justice for all people. The principles which made our country great and which it was founded upon and Donald Trump unapologetically stands for those values. We are one in our belief that America must address the national debt, not by increasing taxes but by increasing opportunity. We are one in our belief that we must protect our borders and promote fair trade that puts America workers first. And we are one in our belief that we must stand with our allies like Israel, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the Middle East. And we are one in our belief that we must respect and honor our military, our veterans and law enforcement whose sacrifice keeps us safe and free. And we are one in our belief that every life is precious, regardless of race or class including the lives of the unborn children. And as a party, we don't agree 100 percent on everything. That's okay, we don't have to. As Ronald Reagan once said, ''The person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally.'' We invite every American who believes in these principles and longs for an end to division and wants to make America one again to join us in electing Donald Trump as president of the United States. Thank you and may God bless you all. God bless America.",4,,,
Reince Priebus,"Thank you. Thank you. To the people of Cleveland, we say thank you for your hospitality. And to my wife, Sally, and my son, Jack, and daughter, Grace, I love you. Thank you for everything you do for me. I stand before this convention tonight as the chairman of a party that is carrying the torch of liberty. We are the party of the open door. To some people and some presidents, America's just another country. To Republicans, America is the greatest nation on earth. We don't apologize for America. We celebrate America at every level. Republicans stand for aspiration and achievement. We stand for peace and prosperity. We stand for freedom and fairness. These values have inspired people the world over. Ever since we won our freedom two centuries ago, these values fueled the sacrifices for freedom at Gettysburg, in Normandy and Fallujah. These values spurred the fight for equality in Birmingham and Selma. It is clear the Republican Party is the only party willing to fight for these values and lead America to greatness in the 21st century. You see, the dirty little secret Democrats don't want you to know is that they're the same party doing the same old thing. Next week, they're going to trot out the same old Democrats with the same old message, running the same old candidate. We are the party of new ideas in a changing and faster world than ever before. Democrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the back door. We are the party of the grassroots. We honor what the voters say. Democrats wanna put labour union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices and feed our kids a steady of diet of the left wing propaganda. We know every child matters and the classroom is not an assembly line. It's time to give power back to parents, embrace school choice, equip our children with the skills they need for college, career and life. Democrats want health care choices in the hands of politicians. We want health care choices in the hands of patients. Democrats want Washington to impose a one size fits all policy on everybody. We say, ''An independent people deserves individual solutions.'' What separates Republicans from Democrats is our belief in better. We believe in better schools, a better health care system, a better economy which rewards hard work, no matter where or when you punch the clock. And most of all, we believe in a better chance at the American dream for everyone. The Republican Party will not stop until that becomes a reality, and that's why we need to stop Hillary Clinton. A Clinton presidency only means more debt, more Obamacare and more hardworking families never seeing a raise. If Hillary Clinton is given a chance, she'll stack the deck with the Supreme Court with activist left-wing judges who will treat the Constitution like a doormat. You can kiss your gun rights goodbye if she ever finds her way into the White House. In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies. Just look, just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal which line the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.It was on her watch Isis began to spread its wings of evil over the Middle East. And she has spent the last 16 months looking in the eyes of the American people and lying about how recklessly she jeopardized the American people, our national security with her secret email server. She lied! And she lied over and over and over and over and over. She lied! She lied! ÉPerhaps worst of all, Hilary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. Just look at her track record. She used her post as Secretary of State to grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests, and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton machine. Her family foundation took millions of dollars in donations from countries notorious for human rights abuses and funneling money to radical Islamic terrorists. For Hilary Clinton, the Oval Office is just another cash cow. Well, I have one word for all of this hypocrisy and corruption. Enough. Americans have had enough of a government that plays favorites to the well connected. They've had enough of the Clinton's excuses, cronyism and cover-ups. They have had enough of the corrupt deals. Americans have had enough! This election is our chance to stop it and Donald Trump is the right man to lead that charge. You all know he's brought millions of new voters in our party, because he's listening to Americans who are anxious about a country who has lost its way. Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back from overseas and hold companies who want to send them abroad accountable. He's finally going to stop illegal immigration and make sure our government puts American citizens first. Working families are the lifeblood of our country and we can't thrive as a nation unless they are thriving. A lot of them haven't seen a bigger paycheck in a very long time. Donald Trump wants to make sure you can pay the mortgage, put gas in the car, and buy new clothes for the first day of school. Donald Trump is committed to hitting terrorists hard and making the safety of every man, woman and child in America his number one priority. No more negotiating with terrorists. If they want to take us down, we're going to take them down. And he will protect the Second Amendment and every other right guaranteed in the Constitution by approving and appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court. And importantly, he's going to protect the lives of the unborn. So I have a message to America. Hold on, help is coming. With Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America's ready for a comeback after almost of a decade of Clinton-Obama failures. I want to close by telling you a little known story of American greatness. William Knudsen was a Danish immigrant, who started out working in a shipyard and living in a boarding house.He knew America promised limitless opportunity and was determined to make the most of it. He developed his talents for industrial engineering and worked his way up at General Motors. By 1937, he had become the president of the company.In 1940, the government asked him to get America's factories on a wartime footing. Instead of cars and trucks, America's great manufacturers were now proudly making tanks and planes. For this enormous responsibility, Knudsen was paid $1 per year.He didn't do it for the money. He was motivated by a duty to keep America free from tyranny. He set aside the job of leading one of the largest companies in America so he could help save the world.At the end of the war, a War Department official told him, ''You have never done anything for yourself, only for your country. You have never spared yourself.''Like William Knudsen, we cannot spare ourselves either.Economic freedom. Belief in the American Dream. A strong defense. Putting country first. Those values are under assault from Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrat Party.Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not just a tagline for a bumper sticker. It is our American legacy, and it is our responsibility to save it and strengthen it for our children and grandchildren.Listen, God didn't put us here by accident. This is our moment to set a new course for an America as strong and confident as we've ever been.Let's stand united as Republicans!Let's stop Hillary Clinton!Let's get to work, expand our Republican majorities, and let's elect Donald Trump president!Thank you and God bless you.",4,,,
Jerry Falwell Jr,"I am so honored and humbled to be here tonight. In 1984, my father stood at this convention and offered the opening prayer before our party's candidate Ronald Reagan went on to accept the nomination and win in a landslide. A little over 30 years later, I stand here with the sincerest prayer and history is about to repeat itself with the election of Donald J Trump. You know, most of our nation's founders had strong faith as I do in our lord and savior Jesus Christ. My family has lived in Virginia since the 1600's and in the Lynchburg, Virginia area since 1834. My wife, Becky, is a descendant of George Washington's family. Everyday I drive past Poplar Forest, the summer home of Thomas Jefferson who wrote in the Declaration of Independence, ''We are in endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness''. Our founding fathers envisioned a government that existed only to protect these God given rights and a nation governed by citizen legislators. The most effective politicians were never career politicians but surveyors, architects, ministers, farmers, businessmen and even actors who were successful in the private sector before serving in government. Donald Trump follows in this rich tradition. He has created jobs for thousands and is one of the greatest visionaries of our time. I first supported Mr Trump after I spent 20 years as a young lawyer working with my father to restore Liberty University to financial health. Since 2007, Liberty has become the largest and most prosperous Christian university in the world. And I am convinced that Donald Trump can work that same magic for a nation with $19 trillion in debt. My family and I have grown to love and respect the Trumps for other reasons. We have never met such a genuine and loving family. I truly believe Mr Trump is America's blue collar billionaire. He is down to Earth. He loves America and the American people. He is a true patriot and a champion of the common man. Mr Trump has added a plank to this parties platform to repel IRS rules sponsored by Lyndon Johnson in 1954 barring churches and non-profits from expressing political free speech. Conservative universities and churches however have been investigated while authorities have too often turned a blind eye toward liberal groups, including universities who are left wing ideologies so pervasive that they have in effect become Democratic voter indoctrination camps. Trust me, the repel of the Johnson amendment will create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech. We are at a crossroads where our first priority must be saving our nation. We must unite behind Donald Trump and Mike Pence.If you are a conservative, a decision not to vote or to vote for a third party candidate is a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. If Hilary Clinton is allowed to appoint the next few Supreme Court justices, that in itself could be a fatal blow to our republic.On the other hand, a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to uphold the Second Amendment right to bear arms. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to stop Iran -- a nation committed to the destruction of the state of Israel -- from becoming a nuclear power. A vote for Trump is a vote to appoint conservative pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.You know, in the days before my father passed away in 2007, he joked with CNN that he dreamed that Chelsea Clinton had interviewed him about the three greatest threats. He replied those three greatest threats are ''Osama, Obama, and your mama''. Well, Osama is now gone. Obama has six months left in his term. And the only way to make America great and one again is to tell Chelsea's mama, ''You're fired.'' And the only way to do that is to elect Donald Trump and Mike Pence president and vice president of the United States. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America!",4,,,
Peter Thiel,"Good evening. I'm Peter Thiel. I build companies and I'm supporting people who are building new things, from social networks to rocket ships. I'm not a politician. But neither is Donald Trump. He is a builder, and it's time to rebuild America.Where I work in Silicon Valley, it's hard to see where America has gone wrong. My industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it's made a lot of money. But Silicon Valley is a small place. Drive out to Sacramento, or even just across the bridge to Oakland, and you won't see the same prosperity. That's just how small it is.Across the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than ten years ago. But healthcare and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton's speaking fees. Our economy is broken. If you're watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington D.C.And you know this isn't the dream we looked forward to. Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it right here in Cleveland. They brought me here as a one-year-old and this is where I became an American. Opportunity was everywhere. My dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University, just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world's high tech capital wasn't just one city: all of America was high tech.It's hard to remember this, but our government was once high tech, too. When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moonÐand it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio. The future felt limitless.But today our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can't even fly in the rain. And it would be kind to say the government's software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn't even work at all. That is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project. We don't accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government.Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don't need to see Hillary Clinton's deleted emails: her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya, and today it's a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue Donald Trump is right. It's time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country.When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?Of course, every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American. I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform; but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.While it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it's even more important to remember where we came from. For me that is Cleveland, and the bright future it promised.When Donald Trump asks us to Make America Great Again, he's not suggesting a return to the past. He's running to lead us back to that bright future.Tonight I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.",4,,,
Ivanka Trump,"Good Evening. Thank you. One year ago, I introduced my father when he declared his candidacy. In his own way, and through his own sheer force of will, he sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider, and he prevailed against a field of 16 very talented competitors. For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people's champion, and tonight he is the people's nominee.Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote right based on what I believe is right for my family and for my country. Sometimes, it's a tough choice. That is not the case this time. As the proud daughter of your nominee, I am here to tell you that this is the moment and Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.Real change, the kind we have not seen in decades, is only going to come from outside the system, and it's only going to come from a man who has spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. When the primaries got tough Ñand they were toughÑ he did what any great leader does: he dug deeper, worked harder, got better, and became stronger. I have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company. And now I am seeing him fight for our country. It's been the story of high life and, more recently, the spirit of his campaign. It's also a prelude to reaching the goal that unites us all when this party, and better still this country, knows what it is like to win again.If it's possible to be famous, and yet not really well-known, that describes the father who raised me. In the same office in Trump Tower where we now work together, I remember playing on the floor by my father's desk, constructing miniature buildings with Legos and Erector Sets, while he did the same with concrete, steel, and glass. My father taught my siblings and me the importance of positive values and a strong, ethical compass. He showed us how to be resilient, how to deal with challenges, and how to strive for excellence in all that we do. He taught us that there is nothing we cannot accomplish if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic.One of my father's greatest talents is his ability to see the potential in people before they see it in themselves. It was like that for us too, growing up. He told us that potential vanishes into nothing without effort and, like him, we each had a responsibility to work not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world around us. Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met who were facing some injustice or hardship. He'd write a note to his assistant in his signature, black, felt-tipped pen, and requested the person invited to Trump Tower to meet with him. He would talk with them, and then draw upon his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break. And they would leave his office, as people so often do after being with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again.Throughout my entire life, I have witnessed his empathy and generosity towards others, especially those who are suffering. It is just his way of being in your corner when you're down. My father not only has the strength and ability necessary to be our next president, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader that this country needs. My father has a sense of fairness that touches every conviction he's held. I've worked alongside of him for more than a decade now at the Trump Organization and I've seen how he operates a leader, making important conversations that shape careers and change lives. I've learned a lot about the world from walking construction jobs by his side. When run properly, construction sites are true meritocracies. Competence in the building trades is easy to spot, and incompetence is impossible to hide. These sites are also incredible melting pots, gathering people from all walks of life, and uniting them to work towards a single mission. There have always been men of all backgrounds and ethnicities on my father's job sites, and long before it was commonplace, you also saw women.My fathers values talents. He recognizes real knowledge and skill will when he finds it. He is colorblind and gender-neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period. Words and promises, no matter how visionary they sound, will only get you so far. In our business, you're not a builder unless you've got a building to show for it. Or, in my father's case, city skylines.Most people strive their entire lives to achieve complete success in a single industry. My father has succeeded in many on the highest level and on a global scale. One of the reasons he has thrived as an entrepreneur is because he listens to everyone. Billionaire executives don't usually ask the people doing the work for their opinion of the work. My father is an exception. On every one of his projects, you'll see him talking to the super, the painter, the engineers, the electricians. He'll ask them for their feedback, if they think something should be done differently or could be done better. When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort, and excellence.This has long been the philosophy at the Trump Organization. At my father's company, there are more female than male executives. Women are paid equally for the work that we do and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out. Women represent 46 percent of the total US labor force and 40 percent of American households have females primary breadwinners. In 2014, women made 83 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Single women without children earned 94 cents for each dollar earned by a man, whereas married mothers only made 77 cents. As researchers have noted, gender is no longer the factor creating the biggest wage discrepancy in this countryÑmotherhood is. As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce, and he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all.As a mother myself of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family, and I also know that I am far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties; they should be the norm. Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career. He will fight for equal pay, for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him.Americans today need an economy that permits people to rise again. A Trump presidency will turn the economy around and restore the great American tradition of giving each new generation hope for brighter opportunities than those of the generation that came before. In Donald Trump, you have a candidate who knows the difference between wanting something done and making it happen. When my father says that he will build a tower, keep an eye on the skyline. Floor by floor a soaring structure will appear, usually record-setting in its height and iconic in its design. Real people are hired to do real work. Vision becomes reality. When my father says that he will make America great again, he will deliver.We have a chance this year to reclaim our heritage as a country that dreams big and makes the impossible happen. Fortunately, Donald Trump is incapable of thinking small. When I was a child, my father always told me ''Ivanka, if you're gonna be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.'' As president, my father will take on the bold and worthy fights. He will be unafraid to set lofty goals and he will be relentless in his determination to achieve them. To people all over America, I say: when you have my father in your corner, you will never again have to worry about being let down. He will fight for you all the time, all the way, every time.Maybe it's the developer in him, but Donald Trump cannot stand to see empty main streets and boarded up factories. He can't bear the injustice of college graduates who are crippled by student debt and mothers who can't afford the cost of the childcare required to return to work to better the lives of their families. Other politicians see these hardships, see the unfairness of it all, and they say ''I feel for you.'' Only my father will say ''I'll fight for you.''The hardworking men and women of this country identify with my father. He is tough and he is persevering. He is honest and he is real. He's an optimist and he's a relentless believer in America and all of her potential. He loves his family and he loves his country with his heart and his soul. Politicians asked to be judged by their promises, not their results. I ask you to judge my father by his results. Judge his values by those he's instilled in his children; judge his competency by the towers he's built, the companies he's founded, and the tens of thousands of jobs he's created. He is the single most qualified person to serve as Chief Executive of an $18 trillion economy.My father will call upon the best and brightest people from all spheres of industry and both sides of the aisle: a new set of thinkers to face our country's existing and future problems with fresh perspective and brave, new solutions. Come January 17, all things will be possible again. We can hope, and dream, and think big again. No one has more faith in the American people than my father. He will be your greatest, your truest, and your most loyal champion.This is the fighter, the doer that you have chosen as your nominee. In ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission and given it to and extraordinary man. He is ready to see it all the way through, to speak to every man and every woman of every background in every part of this great country to earn your trust and to earn your vote. He earned that and much more from me a long time ago. I have loved and respected him my entire life and I could not be more proud to present to you, and to all of America, my father and our next president: Donald J Trump.",4,,,

We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths Ñ the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts:Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the president's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total of 2015.They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper:Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are now not employed.2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office eight years ago.Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That is 16 years ago.Our trade deficit in goods reached Ñ think of this Ñ our trade deficit is $800 hundred billion dollars. Think of that. $800 billion last year alone. We will fix that.The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another.We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing. It will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.In Libya, our consulate, the symbol of American prestige around the globe was brought down in flames.America is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.Her bad instincts and her bad judgment, something pointed out by Bernie Sanders are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq had seen a big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: Death, destruction and terrorism and weakness.But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now Ñ poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad Ñ will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.Tonight, I will share with you for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America first. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve. The American people will come first once again.First, my plan will begin with safety at home which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It is for their benefit. For their benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever.My message is that things have to change and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that had been ignored, neglected and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten, but they will not be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws, or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way.And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no no consequence Ñ I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.When the FBI director says that the Secretary of State was ''extremely careless'' and ''negligent'' in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others who have been far less have paid so dearly.When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders. He never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: Trade deals that strip our country of jobs and the distribution of wealth in the country.Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every American.In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their Ñ our communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seeing.This administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and on every single level.When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have really come in every way, have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. And we are going to defeat them bad.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over. At the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community.No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best, absolutely the best, gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best.We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, in Egypt, and Syria.Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel.Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete. Because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase Ñ think of this, this is not believable, but this is what is happening Ñ a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of president Obama.She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly.Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and none too protest on their behalf.My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Is so sad to even be talking about this. We can solve it so quickly. Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, immigration system.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It will not be happening very much anymore. Believe me.Peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very closely to the words I am about to say: On on January 20 of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from the tremendous cycle of poverty they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat Ñ of which there are many.It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest businesspeople of the world, I'm going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back our jobs to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the world trade organization. Another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership which will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it is not going to happen.I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and Independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. American first.Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about, they are the greatest currently manipulators ever.Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and will walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal. Our country is going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me. It will happen and it will happen fast.Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end and it very quickly.We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never happen with Donald J trump as president. Our steelworkers and are miners are going back to work again.With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of our tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs.We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. That is what she is doing and that is what she has done.We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again.And we will fix TSA at the airports, which is a total disaster. Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problems.We will completely rebuild our depleted military. And the countries that we protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released 10 point plan has received tremendous better support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in a line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal, one more sign of how out of touch she really is.We are going to ask every department head and government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association. And will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me Ñ and I'm not sure I totally deserve it Ñ has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies.Yet our laws prevent you from speaking your mind from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. I will work hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.We can accomplish these great things and so much more. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves a in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job?My dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.",4,,,
Donald Trump,"Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. She could pick them out from anywhere.To my sisters, Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. It is time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: All of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people, that would not stand, I mean they said Trump does not have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance, the same people. We love defeating those people, don't we? Love it.No longer can we rely on those same people. In the media and politics who, will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to believe in America.History is watching us now. It's we don't have much time. We don't have much time. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.I am asking for your support tonight so that I can be year champion in the White House. And I will be a champion.Your champion.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ''I'm with her.''I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ''I'm with you the American people.''I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We will make America strong again.We will make America proud again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again!God bless you and goodnight! I love you!It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths Ñ the Democrats are holding their convention next week.

They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others who have been far less have paid so dearly.When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders. He never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: Trade deals that strip our country of jobs and the distribution of wealth in the country.Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every American.In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their Ñ our communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seeing.This administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and on every single level.When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have really come in every way, have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. And we are going to defeat them bad.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over. At the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community.No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best, absolutely the best, gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best.We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, in Egypt, and Syria.Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel.Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete. Because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase Ñ think of this, this is not believable, but this is what is happening Ñ a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of president Obama.She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly.Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and none too protest on their behalf.My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Is so sad to even be talking about this. We can solve it so quickly. Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, immigration system.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It will not be happening very much anymore. Believe me.Peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very closely to the words I am about to say: On on January 20 of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from the tremendous cycle of poverty they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat Ñ of which there are many.It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest businesspeople of the world, I'm going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back our jobs to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the world trade organization. Another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership which will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it is not going to happen.I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and Independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. American first.Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about, they are the greatest currently manipulators ever.Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and will walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal. Our country is going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me. It will happen and it will happen fast.Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end and it very quickly.We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never happen with Donald J trump as president. Our steelworkers and are miners are going back to work again.With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of our tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs.We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. That is what she is doing and that is what she has done.We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again.And we will fix TSA at the airports, which is a total disaster. Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problems.We will completely rebuild our depleted military. And the countries that we protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released 10 point plan has received tremendous better support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in a line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal, one more sign of how out of touch she really is.We are going to ask every department head and government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association. And will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me Ñ and I'm not sure I totally deserve it Ñ has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies.Yet our laws prevent you from speaking your mind from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. I will work hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.We can accomplish these great things and so much more. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves a in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job?My dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. She could pick them out from anywhere.To my sisters, Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. It is time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: All of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people, that would not stand, I mean they said Trump does not have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance, the same people. We love defeating those people, don't we? Love it.No longer can we rely on those same people. In the media and politics who, will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to believe in America.History is watching us now. It's we don't have much time. We don't have much time. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.I am asking for your support tonight so that I can be year champion in the White House. And I will be a champion.Your champion.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ''I'm with her.''I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ''I'm with you the American people.''I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We will make America strong again.We will make America proud again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again!God bless you and goodnight! I love you!",4,,,
